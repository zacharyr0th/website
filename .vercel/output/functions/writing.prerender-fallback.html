While home to many reputable institutions, the industry faces ongoing scrutiny over practices that often escape public view, with major banks facing accusations of regulatory violations.\n\nConflicts of interest exist at every level, as evidenced by the current SEC chairman, Gary Gensler, who amassed significant wealth during his lengthy career at Goldman Sachs before entering public office. Similarly, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell accumulated an estimated $50 million through his work at various investment banks before joining the Treasury Department in 1990. The market has been up only since then, so it's safe to say he's wealthy. In any case, they are the well-connected 0.01% governing the 99.99% in the world's most prosperous country, where 22% of the population didn't even have a bank account in 2019.\n\n## For Reference\n\n\u003cdiv className=\"tableWrapper\"\u003e\n\n| Institution     | Total Regulatory Fines | Violations |\n| --------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |\n| Bank of America | $82.7B                 | 214        |\n| JPMorgan Chase  | $35.7B                 | 158        |\n| Citigroup       | $25.4B                 | 122        |\n| Wells Fargo     | $21.3B                 | 181        |\n| Deutsche Bank   | $18.1B                 | 59         |\n| UBS             | $16.7B                 | 83         |\n| Goldman Sachs   | $16.3B                 | 44         |\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nNot all banks are bad, just as not all DeFi protocols are good. The table above illustrates the scale of regulatory violations in traditional banking, highlighting why alternative financial systems have gained attention. Let's explore how we got here.\n\n# The Evolution of Central Banking\n\nThe Federal Reserve (FED) was established in 1913 as the third attempt at a central banking system in the United States. After the bank runs of 1907-1910 caused by fractional reserve lending, Chase Bank's founder J.P. Morgan and other influential bankers developed a plan that became the Federal Reserve—a hybrid faction within the US government that sets banking standards but operates independently of direct voter control.\n\n## The Mandate\n\nThe Federal Reserve operates under what is known as the \"dual mandate,\" established by Congress in the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977.\n\nThe two primary objectives are:\n\n1. Maximum employment (not a specific unemployment rate)\n2. Price stability (which the Fed has interpreted as targeting 2% inflation over time)\n\nThe Fed seeks to achieve these goals through various monetary policy tools, primarily by adjusting interest rates and managing the money supply. The 2% inflation target wasn't officially adopted until 2012, when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) first explicitly stated this goal. Interest rates have been trending down for centuries and the consequences and byproducts of money printing are debated over.\n\n![Historical interest rates trend over 400 years showing a declining pattern](/images/400y-interest.webp)\n\n## Side Effects\n\nOne way to evaluate the Federal Reserve's economic impact is by examining two key relationships: the correlation between its balance sheet and the S\u0026P 500 index, and the long-term trajectory of the US dollar's purchasing power.\n\n![Federal Reserve balance sheet correlation with S\u0026P 500](/images/fed-sp.webp)\n\nWall street optimists argue that because of the US's dominance, it doesn't matter how much money is printed and centralized intermediaries are a battle-tested system that is worth more than the trouble of occasionally bailing out a few bad actors.\n\nSo, where does DeFi come in? It varies. If you're in one of the wealthier countries in the world, you may utilize DeFi as an alternative or speculative investment class but for those in less financially secure countries, you may be using DeFi because you don't have any other option.\n\n# DeFi\n\nFor those in non-financially secure countries, what's the alternative? A continuation of opaque market procedures, unsustainable monetary policy, and hyper-inflationary events of debased fiat currencies becoming the norm?\n\n## DeFi's Use Cases Today\n\n### Stable Coins\n\nLet's say you live in Turkey. The Turkish Lira experienced a reported 78% inflation from 2021-2022. So, if the bank gives you back your deposit, your $100 worth of TRL will be roughly $22. This type of heartache used to be unavoidable for the global middle and lower classes, but now there's an alternative.\n\nInstead of using a soon-to-be-defunct domestic bank in a country with a falling currency, you can open a non-custodial wallet like Solflare and securely store infinite digital assets. This wallet isn't physical. You can bring it across borders by remembering your recovery phrase or keeping a copy of your private key.\n\nOperational security risks and other nuances need to be considered, but this example gives you an idea of what's possible. How easy is it to withdraw $25,000 from your bank? How easy is it to travel across violent borders with that $25,000—especially if that $25,000 worth of value is in a currency other than the USD? The answers are all that it is exceedingly difficult to do so without DeFi.\n\n### Censorship Resistance\n\nReal estate debt levels and nationalized industry have taken a toll on the Chinese banking system, and some banks have already censored withdrawals. Chinese authorities recently switched some citizen health codes from Covid negative to positive (which effectively banned them from all public venues and transport systems) to prevent them from withdrawing from their bank. In May of 2022, it was reported that nearly 1 million Chinese customers were unable to withdraw money from bank accounts.\n\nThen tanks were deployed on the protesters who had their funds frozen.\n\n![Chinese tanks deployed during bank protests](/images/tank-webp.png)\n\nRegarding centralization and censorship, China is extreme, but the world operates on a spectrum. The need for DeFi also operates on that spectrum.\n\n### Yield Generation\n\nCrypto builders have developed various approaches to generating yields, with varying degrees of legitimacy and sustainability. Some mechanisms represent genuine financial innovation but others - particularly centralized platforms like the now-defunct Celsius - proved to be poorly regulated and over-leveraged systems that misrepresented risks. Liquidity pools stand out as an example of legitimate yield generation that democratizes access to trading profits.\n\nAutomated Market Makers (AMMs) are smart contracts deployed on blockchains that enable asset trading through algorithmically managed liquidity pools. These systems compensate liquidity providers in two primary ways: through a share of trading fees or through incentive token distributions. The revenue model for most decentralized exchanges (DEXes) centers on distributing trading fees to liquidity providers - a stark contrast to traditional finance where such yields were typically restricted to institutional market makers.\n\nBelow is a list of the top 5 7-Day Average Fees metrics DEXes across various blockchains.\n\n![Uniswap and other DEX statistics](/images/uniswap.webp)\n\nThis democratization of market-making represents a significant shift from traditional financial structures. The blockchain infrastructure underlying these systems also brings unprecedented transparency, as trading activities and settlements are recorded on public ledgers, simplifying what was historically an opaque process.\n\nRyan Selkis, the CEO of Messari, recently published a [thread](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1551874256761659393?s=20\u0026t=cDNrQAr0FsQJXotpRolEAA) of 35 use cases for which you can use DeFi. It's worth a scroll.\n\n# A Balanced Approach\n\nThe emergence of Defi represents more than just a technological evolution in financial services—it marks a fundamental shift in how we think about and interact with money. The traditional financial systems have served as the backbone of global commerce for centuries but their limitations and vulnerabilities have become increasingly apparent in the digitally age. Defi's promise lies not in replacing these systems outright, but in providing alternatives that address their core limitations: accessibility, transparency, and resistance to censorship.\n\nAs we move forward, the challenge will be striking the right balance between innovation and stability, and between decentralization and practical utility. The future of finance likely lies in a thoughtful integration of both traditional and decentralized finance, where each serves the purposes for which it is best suited. For those seeking alternatives to traditional banking—whether due to economic instability, political censorship, or a desire for greater financial autonomy—DeFi offers not just hope, but increasingly practical solutions.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"e:[\"crypto\"]\nf:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"A Bird's Eye View\"}\n10:T1ff6,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nBlockchains are ever-expanding ledgers of transactions that have distinct features and functionalities which differentiate them from traditional computing networks. As a result, they open doors to new ways of doing things and this article explores the foundational knowledge required to understand them from the ground up.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nThe impl of a blockchain is for transactions to be Transactions are grouped into blocks and verified by a distributed network of computers that earn money for participating in the verification process. Distributed means that these computers are not governed by any central entity but rather by a widespread collection of individual entities. This network collectively creates a public ledger that can be indexed and searched with extreme detail. Anything that happens on a public blockchain is immediately and immutably a part of the public record.\n\n## Accounts \u0026 Wallets\n\nEach account is accessed with a digital wallet. Accounts hold an individual or entity's tokens, which can be freely transferred between wallets and interact with applications that are compatible with the wallet. These applications can be financial or used for gaming, messaging, and virtually anything else.\n\nUnlike traditional markets, blockchains operate all day, so on-chain markets run 24/7, and anyone with a wallet can participate.\n\n## Reducing Counterparty Risk\n\nConsensus methods are the backbone of any blockchain. In the next chapter, we'll explain their work in more detail. They are meant to give disparate network participants the ability to verify the truth without trusting anyone or relying on any centralized entity to act accurately or ethically.\n\nNot wanting to trust a counterparty may sound counterintuitive, but if there is no counterparty, then there is no counterparty risk. If there are no ethics, there is no misbehavior. It's a technical philosophy embodied in the code behind decentralized systems, and it's all possible because of consensus methods.\n\nConsensus methods are algorithms that an incentivized computer network uses to participate in collective transaction verification. The process of how this works varies from method to method.\n\n## Digital Transparency\n\nSpecific blockchains (ZEC, MXR, SCRT) are oriented towards privacy, but most are transparent by default. A blockchain scanner can openly search and index every detail of every transaction, as shown below.\n\nYou can see that 0.00203928 SOL was transferred from one wallet to another on March 18, 03:21:07 AM +UTC, and the transaction fee was 0.000005 SOL (a fraction of $0.01).\n\nOn other blockchains, transaction fees can quickly go into the dozens and hundreds of dollars, depending on network congestion. Using Solana, you can make 1,000,000 trades and only pay ~$10 in transaction fees.\n\n## The Store of Value Narrative\n\nBitcoin was initially intended to be a peer-to-peer medium of exchange, although its narrative has switched mainly to that of a global store of value. Countries that use their proprietary currency other than the big six (USD—United States Dollar, CAD—Canadian Dollar, EUR—Euro, AUS—Australian Dollar, JPY—Japanese Yen, and GBP—British Pound) are subject to grave risks imposed by the arbiters of the big six.\n\nRather than hold onto, for example ��� the Turkish Lira or South African Rand and have their spending power decline over time, many have fled to BTC or other cryptocurrencies that enable pseudonymous, secure transfers of value and opportunities for capital appreciation. Bitcoin, for example, increased in value by 6,965,454,545.45% between 2010 and 2021.\n\nIts low was $0.00099, and the all-time high was $$68,958.\n\n## Uncertainty\n\nFinancial markets serve many critical economic functions, although they do not always reflect what's happening in the real world. They often aren't. The stock market, for example, is constantly attempting to base prices and valuations on future expectations. To predict future outcomes, you want the least amount of uncertainty involved.\n\nMarkets are always searching for certainty.\n\nWhen outcomes are uncertain – such as when a supply chain crisis, a war, or a pandemic occurs- prices will reflect that. Speculative assets like revenueless tech stocks or purposeless altcoins will reflect uncertainty by having their price spike downwards because there is no more perceived value. Re-pricings will occur, even if it's not immediate. It's easy to forget that asset prices can go down another 99% after dropping by 99%.\n\n## Mimetic Desire\n\nPhysical gold bars have historically outperformed most assets during periods of economic strife. As a result, gold has become a haven asset in the eyes of asset managers. It's important to understand that money flows from speculative investments to safe-haven assets doesn't happen automatically. It's a result of trader psychology being influenced by mimetic desire, and it happens slowly, then all at once.\n\nOther than its use in jewelry and select manufacturing, gold is perceived to exist outside of the traditional financial system, although banks are the largest owners of it. Derivatives are constantly used to manipulate its price, so that is a relatively naïve assumption. Below is one of the many headlines detailing big bank baboonery. In this instance, JPM Chase had to pay a $920 million fine.\n\nSource\nEven though gold has performed well in the past during times of distress, this rise in value is not based on any fundamental, intrinsic characteristic. Gold is not easy to transport or store, especially at scale. Try moving $1 billion in gold across an ocean. Due to the large number of industry players, gold is a very centralized commodity, and the price will only be appreciated because of a fluctuating extrinsic value. Someone will see that someone else has gold, and they'll want it.\n\nWhat if everyone thought silver was a better store of value, or tungsten, or rhodium, or zinc… or Bitcoin?\n\n## Bitcoin as Digital Gold\n\nNarratives drive markets as much as fear and uncertainty do. Although gold hasn't been a practical currency in hundreds, if not thousands, of years in most places, big banks, and asset managers still recommend it as a haven asset worthy of 1-5% of a traditional financial nest egg in the off-chance that calamity happens.\n\nThe narrative that it stores its value in times of distress is just that – a narrative. It will work until it doesn't. If rarity or scarcity is the argument, there are more scarce assets on this planet that could replace gold if the narrative shifted—Bitcoin is one of them.\n\nAs proposed in the white paper, Bitcoin was initially conceived as a peer-to-peer method of exchange. It has since become part of the larger store of value narrative to which gold can attribute its declining relevance, except this time—it's digital. Bitcoin has been referred to as Digital Gold by many investors and mainstream media pundits, partially because that's the most digestible explanation they can come up with for its sucess, and partially because it's true.\n\n## Censorship Resistance\n\nSome blockchains, particularly the privacy ones listed above, are intended to resist censorship. The goal is for anyone to build and use them. There are no credit checks; the only requirement to open a digital wallet is an internet connection.\n\nThe reality of censorship resistance in crypto is that some blockchains do a better job than others. The blockchain industry is barely a teenager, and there are many schools of thought regarding how it should operate. Maximalism, tribalism, game theory, and investor bias contribute to a never-ending conversation on which consensus methods and blockchain infrastructure are the most secure and censorship-resistant.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"11:[\"crypto\"]\n12:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"Blockchain Foundations\"}\n13:T24c3,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nBlockchain technology is gaining traction in Africa, offering innovative solutions to longstanding economic challenges, although no single blockchain has been able to establish a strong footing in the region.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003e \"Are blockchains a solution looking for a problem?\"\n\nThis was Ravi Menon's keynote remark as the Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). He later clarified his answer, stating, \"Blockchain technology is mostly use-case driven: there is almost always a real problem to be solved.\"\n\nRavi's question above implies a common misperception of cryptocurrency's role in developed economies and is a consistent argument made by critics and no-coiners alike.\n\n## Africa\n\nAfrica is a resource-rich, expansive landscape that can fit China, India, the USA, and half of Europe's landmass within its boundaries. Roughly 1.5 billion people live across 54 countries, and it's estimated that 40% of the population is 15 years old or younger. Its population is expected to grow to 2.5 billion by 2050.\n\nProminent players like Nigeria and Seychelles, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mauritius, Kenya, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Tanzania have already made inroads or formally declared their interest in blockchain and fintech industries.\n\n![Graph showing the increase in remittances sent via crypto to Africa over the past few years](/images/ba-1.webp)\n\nNigeria and Seychelles raised over 50% of all blockchain-based venture capital investments on the continent as Africa's YoY VC investment increased by 1100%. Nigeria is also one of the largest oil exporters in the world and has become the wealthiest country in Africa. As oil cruises to near all-time highs, Nigeria collects a pretty penny from energy-dependent countries like India, China, and elsewhere in Africa. While Nigerian millionaires grew by 44% over the past decade, 60% of the country still lives on less than $1 / day, so there is ample room for crypto economies to disrupt the country with the 10th largest GDP and help level the playing field.\n\n## Blockchains as a Solution\n\n### Currencies\n\nWhile blockchain adoption is generally moving in the right direction, it's important to note that many currencies in the region are experiencing unacceptable inflation levels, like the Nigerian Naira, whose annual inflation rate accelerated to 16.82% in April of this year. That doesn't bode well for individuals or corporations who simply need to facilitate transactions or save their money. Blockchains offer a solution to outsource savings from volatile currencies and unstable banking systems to more stable stores of value like USDC, USDT, and other fiat-backed stablecoins. It also provides a framework for fundraising and investment that is transparent and accessible to all.\n\nCurrencies traditionally have acted very similar to languages in that the ones that survive only do so with an army and a navy. Bitcoin changed that. Bitcoin, and blockchains in general, offer new frameworks for global payment rails. Rather than be subject to the volatility of Bitcoin or the more minor domestic currencies that tend to be manipulated by outside forces, African countries can take advantage of both stable coins and interconnected token networks to expand upon their economic progress.\n\n### Remittances\n\nAfrican remittances have nearly been in a perpetual bull market. The following represents the number of remittances sent via crypto to Africa over the past few years.\n\n![Graph showing the increase in remittances sent via crypto to Africa over the past few years](/images/ba-2.webp)\n\nRemittances are payments foreign workers send back home to their families. The remittance industry is a fairly dirty one. Average wiring fees are 7.45%, which equates to over 27 days of a low-income worker's annual income. In 2017, low—and middle-income country remittances amounted to $466 billion, and remittance fees were $34.7 billion. This is not stealing from the rich and giving to the poor; it's quite the opposite.\n\nTo put the dollar value of these fees into perspective, the US's non-military foreign aid budget was $34 billion in 2017.\n\nCrypto does fix this. Using Solana, for example, you can make 1,000,000 transactions for a cost of ~$10. The issue is that banks and vendors in your region may not accept crypto, USDC, or other stablecoins. This is why crypto infrastructure in Africa must improve to facilitate low-fee remittances and benefit from the many other benefits that blockchains enable.\n\n### Debt \u0026 Independence\n\nChina recently banned the holding and transacting of cryptocurrency in preparation for its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). China is also Africa's largest creditor.\n\n![Graph showing China's debt to African countries](/images/ba-3.webp)\n\nTime is a critical component of China's geopolitical strategies. Over the past few decades, Chinese firms have invested extensively in infrastructure projects across the African continent. Many resource-rich but financially developing countries cannot pay their debts, which can lead to several unintended consequences, such as the Chinese government's nationalizing of African public goods.\n\nThe Chinese government has been known to nationalize assets in other countries when it feels that the assets are being used for purposes that are not in the best interests of the Chinese government or its citizens. This has led to concerns about the long-term stability and sovereignty of African countries that have borrowed heavily from China, and it is not an easy problem to fix.\n\nRather than succumb to the external forces that the Chinese government has put on some of the less affluent African countries, blockchains present an alternative financial system for these countries to operate with. Businesses can function globally permissionless, and individuals can self-custody their assets without relying as much on their domestic currency or local banks.\n\n## Blockchains as a Problem\n\nEl Salvador adopted BTC as a domestic currency in June of 2021, and the results have been rather lackluster. At the time of writing, President Nayib Bukele and the El Salvadorian government are down about 30% on their purchase, and citizens are generally unhappy with the situation. Crypto Critics' Corner recorded four podcasts about this situation, and it seems all is not well. Those can be found here - [1](#), [2](#), [3](#), [4](#). Just to note - they are biased no-coiners, so take it with a grain of salt, but to be fair, the IMF recently downgraded El Salvador's credit rating, and the rollout of Bitcoin's Lightning network has been met with significant resistance from vendors and individuals within the country.\n\nIt's also worth considering that Nayib \"deployed the armed forces and civil police around and inside the Legislative Assembly\" to \"coerce the legislative branch to act on his crime bill.\"\n\n![El Salvador Scene](/images/ba-4.webp)\n\nMore recently, the Central African Republic (CAR) made a confusing decision to adopt BTC as a domestic currency this past April. The CAR is ranked 188/189 on the global welfare list, and only 4% of the CAR population has access to the Internet,\n\nOver the past few years, the CAR government has become very close to Putin's regime in Russia after decades of internal strife and external influence from France. French analyst Thierry Vircoulon told the AFP news agency, \"The context, given the systemic corruption and a Russian partner facing international sanctions, does encourage suspicion.\"\n\n![Vibrant river in CAR](/images/ba-5.webp)\n\nTo strawman the other side of the argument, Economist Yann Daworo told BBC Afrique that businesses and individuals \"will no longer have to walk around with suitcases of CFA francs that will have to be converted into dollars or any other currency to purchase abroad.\" This sounds like a cope—will these individuals have to be in the 4% of the country with internet service in order to access their funds? Will the fees associated with transactions on the Bitcoin network eat into CAR citizens' savings? Probably, and yes.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nAs Bitcoin and blockchains are more readily adopted in emerging markets worldwide, the need for scalable, transparent, decentralized networks is becoming more apparent. Still, it needs to be done in ways that benefit the individuals within these markets. Fees on BTC can easily be $5-15 per transaction, which is more than most make in a month in places like the CAR. It's not feasible and is a step backward to have BTC involved when you consider that networks like Solana offer nearly free transacting.\n\nBlockchains are not a panacea. They fix specific problems that are not well understood by the masses, and in their current state, they require a level of financial and technological literacy that is not widespread, so adopters need to be wary of this. In the meantime, Africa continues to invest in blockchain solutions, and builders across the continent continue building.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"14:[\"crypto\"]\n15:{\"src\":\"/images/ba-0.webp\",\"alt\":\"Blockchains in Africa\"}\n16:T2320,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nNamed after an elementary particle described as a force carrier that functions as the 'glue' holding matter together, Boson Protocol has made its mission to build a decentralized commerce ecosystem to disrupt global trade.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nBoson Protocol is a toolset that gives businesses and individuals the control to engage in trustless transactions of physical goods and services using Ethereum as the underlying settlement layer. It enables the tokenization and redemption of physical items through NFTs, the creation of liquid digital markets for these NFTs, and, as a biproduct, the creation of a robust data market.\n\n\u003e \"Commerce is a human endeavor that should not have value captured by the few.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e — Justin Banon, Boson CEO\n\nThe early Internet promised a future of fair and accessible data for all. Instead, market forces favored centralized infrastructure for its profitability. This trend extended to e-commerce, where intermediaries now dominate. These middlemen often exploit user data for profit or fail to utilize it effectively, hindering the potential for a more open and efficient online marketplace.\n\nWeb3's infrastructure - public blockchains, NFTs, digital wallets, etc. — has given vendors a level of control that wasn't available a decade ago. You no longer need to rely on these intermediaries to perform commerce functions or pay an arm and a leg to keep track of commerce data.\n\n![Boson Protocol 1](/images/bp-1.webp)\n\nInspired by trustless and tokenized DeFi communities, Boson Protocol aims to reduce incumbent rent-seeking behavior by creating a decentralized and trustless environment for commerce. The functionality surrounds what are called Commitment tokens, Thing tokens, and the role of the BOSON token.\n\n### Commitment Tokens\n\nA Buyer and Seller commit to exchange digital value for a physical item (a Thing). This commitment is funded \u0026 tokenized into an escrow contract built into an NFT. The NFT serves as a voucher to buy or sell an item, so Boson refers to them as NFTVs. The NFT contract has an expiration date and, in essence, acts as a futures contract where the Seller is obliged to deliver the said item(s) listed in the contract at expiration. Commitment Token holders are granted the right to transfer their token to another wallet or reliably and securely redeem the token for a particular Thing.\n\n#### Commitment Tokens Characteristics\n\n1. **Universal** - Can represent any Thing.\n2. **Interoperable** - Can represent a standardized version of any Thing.\n3. **Composable** - Can be assembled into composite products.\n4. **Programmable** - Fully customizable within computing limits.\n5. **Transferable / Storable** - Between any standard EVM wallet.\n6. **Stateful** - Appropriately change state across the core exchange mechanism process.\n\nThe Core Exchange Mechanism governs Commitment Tokens, where the programmed game theory comes into play. Buyers and Sellers sequentially deposit up-front funds, so there are varying levels of skin in the game on both sides of the transaction. The final deposit transfer process is structured to incentivize both parties to behave well.\n\nUsing this sequential transaction process, Commitment Tokens can achieve a 'Subgame Perfect Equilibrium,' a concept from game theory. This equilibrium ensures that each transaction step is balanced and fair, reducing the potential for disputes. In simpler terms, it's like a game where each player knows the other players' strategy and has nothing to gain by changing only their strategy, leading to a balanced outcome.\n\n![Boson Protocol 2](/images/bp-2.webp)\n\nThe possible game outcomes are the triangles on the right side of the above diagram. CoF stands for Cancel or Fault, which is an undesirable outcome. The most desirable outcome for all parties is 'Redemption; No Complaint; No CoF,' which is the fourth triangle from the top of the diagram. The purpose of programming this game theory into Commitment Tokens is to minimize the number of disputes and arbitration required between Buyers and Sellers, with the hopes of providing a smooth and efficient transaction process.\n\n### Thing Tokens\n\nThing Tokens, which conform to the standard ERC20 contract, are used to purchase Commitment Tokens. Think of a Thing token as a 'generalized Unisock' and the Commitment Token as an add-on futures contract. Unisocks are a grand experiment in scarcity. There were 500 real pairs of Uniswap merchandise socks tokenized as SOCKs and deposited into a liquidity pool on Uniswap along with their starting value worth of ETH.\n\nEach SOCK token represents the redeemable ownership of 1 pair of socks and is minted with a bonding curve, hence the 11,048.07% increase in price from the original $12. You can either sell the token back to the liquidity pool or redeem it for the physical socks, where the Uniswap company will ship a physical pair to you anywhere in the world.\n\n![Boson Protocol 3](/images/bp-3.webp)\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of a single $SOCK token is $132,576.82, and 192 have already been redeemed. Thing tokens are similar. The interoperability and composability of Thing tokens enable them to be fitted or retrofitted into any existing DeFi infrastructure. They are tradable in the same way you can trade SOCKs between different wallets, and they can 'plug' into AMMs (Automated Market Makers) to create liquid digital markets. Their use cases within DeFi include product price discovery on DEXes, yield optimization, and the crowdfunding of non-existent products through ITOs (Initial Thing Offerings).\n\n### Boson Tokens\n\nIncentives are the invisible hand that Adam Smith was talking about. Boson built reward mechanisms within the Thing / Commitment Token relationship to incentivize good behavior by both Buyers and Sellers - but that doesn't tell the whole story. The core objective of the Boson Protocol is to 'maximize the supply of quality redemptions.' In other words, it facilitates successful commerce transactions. To do so, Boson implemented the BOSON token (Bosons) as a monetary reward for actors within the Boson ecosystem who help the protocol reach its objective. Below is a high-level overview of the main stakeholders within the Protocol.\n\n![Boson Protocol 4](/images/bp-4.webp)\n![Boson Protocol 5](/images/bp-5.webp)\n\n### Gluons\n\nThere's also gluons, which act as quality indicators, encouraging participants to stake more capital for higher-quality items. This system incentivizes market participants to engage in high-quality transactions of high-quality physical goods. Each voucher has a unique derivative called a Gluon that represents the stake of the participant holding the voucher and the associated BOSON reward. Vouchers with higher amounts of Gluons indicate items expected to be higher quality than items with lower amounts of Gluons.\n\n### Applications\n\nUnisocks, unrelated to Boson, is a proof of concept for decentralized commerce of physical goods. While the Boson protocol is built for that, their white paper lists other potential use cases.\n\n1. **Online Commerce**: Decentralized e-commerce platform\n2. **M2M-commerce**: Autonomous machine-to-machine transactions\n3. **Loyalty \u0026 Rewards**: Interoperable, composable reward systems\n4. **Gaming**: Physical rewards for in-game achievements\n5. **Crypto Exchanges**: Token redemption for physical rewards\n6. **Service Bookings**: Permissionless, two-sided deposit bookings\n7. **Tokenized Networks**: Token exchange for goods and services\n\n### Scaling\n\nTo scale, Boson estimates they will need to handle, on average, ten transactions per second, with peaks potentially being more than 10x that. To do so, they decided to utilize the most battle-tested layer 1 - Ethereum, which handles dozens of transactions per second. Boson raised $36,000,000 and hired teams covering protocol design \u0026 architecture, legal, engineering \u0026 game theory. After scaling their team to 50+ Boson purchased $700,000+ in digital real estate within Decentraland's Vegas City with the intention of creating Portal, a lifestyle and commerce playground. Portal will enable creators and brands to sell redeemable NFTs for real-world products and services.\n\n![Boson Protocol 8](/images/bp-8.webp)\n\nNow that funds have been raised, the team assembled, and the strategy set, Boson has entered what it calls \"hyper blitz scale mode\" of development. For a detailed explanation of what hyper-blitz scaling means to Boson, refer to their Roadmap article on Medium. Time will tell if supply chains actually adopt models like this.\n\nLet's hope so.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"17:[\"crypto\"]\n18:{\"src\":\"/images/boson.webp\",\"alt\":\"Boson Protocol\"}\n19:T1ee4,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\nDeFi ecosystems are built on interconnected layers - from base blockchain networks and scaling solutions, to core infrastructure like smart contracts and tokens, up to financial primitives such as DEXes and lending protocols. These components enable sophisticated financial services that reimagine traditional finance in new ways. In Balaji's words, YouTube is not TV.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\nDefi represents a fundamental shift in how financial services can be delivered - moving from centralized institutions to open, permissionless protocols. This transformation began with Bitcoin in 2009, but it wasn't until Ethereum introduced smart contracts in 2015 that the true potential of DeFi began to emerge.\n\nThe early DeFi experiments started with projects like MakerDAO (2014) and Compound (2018), but the ecosystem remained relatively small until 2020. The catalyst came during \"DeFi Summer\" of 2020, when the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols exploded from $1 billion to over $15 billion in just a few months. This period saw the birth of automated market makers (AMMs) like Uniswap as well as byproducts like yield farming, and liquidity mining.\n\nBy 2021, DeFi had evolved beyond Ethereum to multiple blockchains, each offering their own innovations - and today's DeFi ecosystem represents an interesting opportunity for traditional financial services are being reimagined through code and consensus.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n| Technology            | Description                                                                                                                             | Examples                                       |\n| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| Layer 1               | The underlying blockchain architecture that supports transaction settlement and application development.

The essence of these applications is token utility and interoperability.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nTo start undersanding DeFi, it's essential to understand the fundamental building blocks that make these systems possible. At the core of the crypto ecosystem lies a crucial distinction between different types of digital assets, each serving unique purposes.\n\nThe distinction between coins and tokens, while not strictly technical or universally adopted, provides a helpful framework for understanding crypto assets.\n\n| Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Coins  | Native currencies of blockchains, used to pay transaction fees (like ETH for Ethereum, SOL for Solana, etc.)                                                                         |\n| Tokens | Smart contracts deployed on top of blockchains. Can be either fungible (like ERC20 tokens) or non-fungible (NFTs), each serving different purposes through their programmable nature |\n\n# Smart Contracts and Tokenomics\n\nSmart contracts are self-executing programs that enable token functionality and form the backbone of DeFi applications. The economic design of these tokens, known as Tokenomics, is crucial for their sustainability. Investors analyze factors like vesting schedules and distribution mechanisms to assess token value.\n\n# Stable Coins\n\nStablecoins are among the highest-priority issues in the regulatory landscape. They are intended to retain a peg to another asset, such as a USD and the biggest stablecoins in the world are USDT and USDC, amounting to roughly $100 billion in combined value.\n\nThree variations of stablecoins have gained prominence.\n\n| Type                | Description                                                                                                                                        | Examples               | Risk Level |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |\n| Asset-backed        | Each token is backed by $1 or $1 worth of assets in reserve                                                                                        | USDT, USDC             | Low        |\n| Over-collateralized | Users deposit excess collateral (e.g., $200 worth of BTC for $100 DAI) to mint stablecoins.

While it's possible to peg stablecoins to other values (like 2 USD or even $3.1415926535), most stablecoins focus on maintaining a 1:1 peg with USD. There are also stablecoins pegged to other currencies like EUR and AUD, but USD-based stablecoins dominate in terms of volume and use cases.\n\n# DeFi\n\nIn traditional finance (TradFi), they've built an entire system on layers of trust in intermediaries. The likelihood of nefarious behavior in your banking system really depends on where you live - and Defi seeks to give everyone an equal opportunity at financial sovereignty and independence.\n\nConsider these everyday scenarios in traditional finance:\n\n\u003col class=\"detailed-list\"\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cstrong\u003eBanking Access\u003c/strong\u003e\n        \u003cul\u003e\n            \u003cli\u003eYou trust bank-displayed balances blindly\u003c/li\u003e\n            \u003cli\u003e\n                Banks' hidden actions\n                \u003cul\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eLend your money without notice\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eFreeze your accounts\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eBlock transactions\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003c/li\u003e\n        \u003c/ul\u003e\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cstrong\u003eTrading Integrity\u003c/strong\u003e\n        \u003cul\u003e\n            \u003cli\u003e\n                Required trust points in brokerage trades\n                \u003cul\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eThe broker executing the trade\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eThe clearinghouse processing it\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eThe custodian holding assets\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003c/li\u003e\n        \u003c/ul\u003e\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cstrong\u003ePayment Processing\u003c/strong\u003e\n        \u003cul\u003e\n            \u003cli\u003e\n                Trust points in card transactions\n                \u003cul\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eThe merchant's payment processor\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eThe card network\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eYour bank's authorization\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003c/li\u003e\n        \u003c/ul\u003e\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cstrong\u003eFinancial Services\u003c/strong\u003e\n        \u003cul\u003e\n            \u003cli\u003e\n                Areas of gatekeeper control\n                \u003cul\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eWho can access financial services\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eWhat transactions are allowed\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eWhen funds can be moved\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003c/li\u003e\n        \u003c/ul\u003e\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"prose\"\u003e\n\n### The Global Trust Divide\n\nIn developed economies, trust in financial institutions is often taken for granted. However, recent history has shown that no financial system is immune to crisis:\n\n#### Developing Economies Face:\n\n- Hyperinflation and currency collapses (Venezuela, Zimbabwe)\n- Sudden bank nationalizations\n- Rampant financial corruption\n- Arbitrary asset seizures and capital controls\n- Limited access to basic banking services\n\n#### Developed Economies Experience:\n\n- Bank runs and failures (2008 Financial Crisis)\n- Account freezes during political unrest\n- Payment censorship\n- Trading halts during market volatility\n- Negative interest rates on savings accounts\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Price Action Preceding Innovation\n\nEthereum paved the way for decentralized projects to bootstrap their funding rounds by issuing tokens in their 2014 ICO (Initial Coin Offering), leading to the ICO mania in 2017. Much has been documented about this time period as it was rife with scams and bewitching celebrities attempting cash grabs while the price of Ethereum soared to nearly $1500 and Bitcoin to almost $20,000.\n\nIn the following years, Ethereum crashed to less than $100, and Bitcoin fell to $3200 during the COVID drop in March 2020. Then it was up only, down only, then up only, and yada yada.\n\nPrice movements historically drive public interest in cryptocurrency. While the 2020 DeFi Summer coincided with Bitcoin's dramatic price recovery, this correlation mainly affected user adoption. Behind the scenes, developers had been consistently building and improving DeFi infrastructure since 2017, regardless of market conditions.\n\n# Defi Summer \u0026 The Standard Stack\n\nAs Bitcoin and Ethereum recovered during the remainder of 2020 after the COVID drop in March, something called DeFi Summer took off. This movement has been in the background since 2017. Protocols like Uniswap, MakerDAO, Curve, Yearn, and Aave took off on Ethereum, enabling the world's first decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading markets.\n\nThis period was rampant with innovation and, at the same time, speculation. Prices were rising at unsustainable rates, and some protocols were failing while their tokens were going to zero. Ecosystems have collectively evolved to establish a core set of essential financial services that are now considered fundamental building blocks.\n\nThese services typically include:\n\n1. Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) for token swapping\n2. Lending and borrowing protocols\n3. Liquidity pools and yield farming\n4. Stablecoin mechanisms\n5. Asset bridging solutions\n\nThey form what's known as the \"DeFi stack\" - a foundational layer that new blockchains must implement to be considered viable for modern decentralized applications. When a new blockchain launches, developers typically prioritize building these core services first, which explains why you'll find similar protocols (like Uniswap-style DEXes or Aave-like lending platforms) replicated across different blockchain ecosystems.\n\n# Case Study\n\nTo truly understand crypto, you need to participate in on-chain transactions.\n\nLet's compare aspects of the trade process at ETrade, one of the world's largest centralized exchanges (CEX), vs. Jupiter Aggregator, Solana's most advanced decentralized exchange (DEX). Jupiter is not just a DEX; it is an aggregator of different DEXes.\n\nIf you submit a trade and Jupiter finds two ways to do it, you'll be presented with the option that offers the better deal.\n\n## ETrade vs Jupiter Aggregator Comparison\n\n| Feature          | ETrade (CEX)                                                  | Jupiter (DEX)                  |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Account Setup    | Complex account opening process (documentation, verification) | Simple wallet connection       |\n| Trading Timeline | Multi-day waiting periods                                     | Immediate trading capability   |\n| Availability     | Limited trading hours                                         | 24/7 operation                 |\n| Custody          | Centralized custody and market makers                         | Non-custodial                  |\n| Market Making    | Payment for order flow (PFOF) model                           | Automated market makers (AMMs) |\n\n# Conclusion\n\nDeFi is powerful, yet it is still only a toddler, and there are growing pains. There have been dozens, if not hundreds, of blockchain applications and exploits, and if you want to get involved, you need to know what you're doing. The remainder of this course focuses on the media's media's buzzwords – NFTs and DAOs. What is essential to consider is these sub-industries within crypto are just logical extensions of what DeFi can do.\n\nConsensus methods are the foundation of blockchains.\n\nBlockchains are the foundations of DeFi.\n\nDeFi is the foundation of everything else.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1d:[\"crypto\"]\n1e:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"Defi\"}\n1f:T2be5,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nDerivative markets significantly influence equity prices through market-maker actions. Real asset values differ from notional values due to monetary policy and market mechanics. While crypto markets are less affected by derivatives, they face unique challenges from well capitalized traders, resulting in illiquidity and volatility.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nThe recent S\u0026P 500 futures (/ES) movement presents an interesting case study:\n\n\u003col className=\"list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2\"\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLarge traders, reportedly including Carl Icahn, accumulated significant positions in 4050 puts\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe market declined to precisely 4050 by expiration\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSubsequently, these traders established new positions in 3950 puts for the following month\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAnd sure enough - the market dropped again\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\nThe relationship between large options positions and market movements can appear to be more than coincidental. While it's impossible to definitively prove causation, the mechanics of dealer hedging combined with market psychology create conditions where large derivative positions can significantly influence the price action of spot assets.\n\nWhy is that? Let's look into it.\n\n## Market Structure\n\nOne largely overlooked aspect of retail trading is market structure. Predicting when to buy/sell is where billions are made, and having a thorough understanding of the market structure and how big players are positioned, or how big positions are played, is one of the market's most predictive resources.\n\nMarket Structure encompasses all market characteristics, such as the number and size of buyers and sellers, competition level, information availability, regulatory environment, and the physical and virtual infrastructures where financial instruments are traded. All of which can significantly affect market efficiency, price discovery, and overall price trajectory.\n\nDuring Covid times, 'gamma squeezes' became a colloquial term on financial news channels. They represent the phenomenon of dealer positioning (Gary), an inevitable result of how equity markets are structured. In short, a 'gamma squeeze' occurs when the acceleration of upside derivative purchases increases, leading to the purchasing of the underlying by cash-heavy dealers, resulting in exponential rises in price, as seen in Gamestop and AMC. When you buy derivatives that profit on the upside on an asset (going long), a dealer can sell you the derivative (going short) and hedge against that by buying the underlying, which is the asset.\n\nWhen the acceleration of upside derivative purchases increases, so does the purchasing of the underlying by cash-heavy dealers, resulting in exponential rises in price, as seen in Gamestop and AMC. Monitoring the call or put volume before a gamma squeeze could give actionable insights on how to trade it.\n\nThis is what a gamma squeeze looks like.\n\n![Derivatives vs Spot](/images/derivatives-1.webp)\n\n### Consequences of 1987\n\nHow can these dealers be so involved when they impact the market so much? The answer is liquidity. Some market-making dealers are legally obliged to place bids under specific market conditions. This is meant to protect the infrastructure and price stability of the underlying and became standard practice after the 1987 crash, which resulted from an overcrowded trade in portfolio insurance. Some traders like Paul Tudor Jones made a killing by being on the right side of this and once the dust settled, the market nearly went up only until the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s.\n\n![Derivatives vs Spot](/images/derivatives-2.webp)\n\nThe crash was a technical reaction to how the market was structured. - there was no fundamental change that provoked the price collapse. Simply put, there were not enough market-making firms willing to place a bid on that frightful morning. Regulators deemed that unacceptable, and market makers have since become one of the primary driving forces of global markets - to a fault.\n\nThe arguably black swan events of 2008 and 2020 were two moments when this market-making backstop failed. In both cases, price conditions were so dire that there seemed to be no buyers left - until the central banks made their money printing intentions clear, as they have time and again.\n\n## Notional Value vs. Real Value\n\nBelow is a graph of the S\u0026P 500 index (traded as /ES) priced in USD.\n\n![Derivatives vs Spot](/images/derivatives-3.webp)\n\nNow compare the index against the Fed's balance sheet.\n\n![Derivatives vs Spot](/images/derivatives-4.webp)\n\nAs you can see, the value of the index in 2007/2008 was around 0.0016. So for every $1 on the Fed's balance sheet, ~$0.0016 of value existed in the S\u0026P 500 index. Quantitative easing and bank bailouts brought floods of new capital into the system and onto the Fed's balance sheet, pushing the value of the index to the $0.0004/0.0006 territory.\n\nThe index has not even come close to its previous highs in relative real value. Meanwhile, a steep rise exists in the USD notional value. This leads to the forgone conclusion that each unit of USD is effectively losing its real value over time.\n\nIn other words, prices are rising. Real value can be measured by a notional value less inflation which results in spending power, but how do we measure inflation? You can listen to what the Fed reports in its CPI numbers, or you can measure your purchases.\n\n### Candy is not a Store of Value\n\n| Product                  | 2014 Weight | 2018 Weight | Change |\n| ------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------ |\n| Snickers (4 pack)        | 232g        | 167g        | -28.1% |\n| Toblerone Milk Chocolate | 200g        | 150g        | -25.0% |\n| Twix Twin Bars (4 pack)  | 200g        | 160g        | -20.0% |\n| Kit Kat Chunky           | 48g         | 40g         | -16.7% |\n\nThe notional value of these candies has not changed, yet the real value of what you are purchasing has declined substantially. This pattern of decreasing returns and increasing prices is common across many industries, such as education, groceries, commodities, ride-sharing services, and streaming platforms. It is not a specific issue, it's a systemic problem.\n\nTo be clear, its probably a good thing that we're getting less candy than before but prices should reflect that reality.\n\n## Asset Scarcity\n\nScarcity, physical or digital, has made its way to the front lines of the debate on asset valuation. One thing is certain: the US dollar is not scarce, nor are the derivatives tied to it.\n\nAccording to Visualise Capitalist's research on the world's money supply, the global derivatives markets outside the world's stock markets by a factor of 11.\n\nA conservative estimate of the notional value of the world's derivative markets is one quadrillion US dollars.\n\nIf that estimate is correct, then for every $1 in a stock market, there are $11 in derivatives betting on what that $1 does. These $11 serve a variety of purposes, such as supply-side hedging, but most are cash-settled speculations. These are side-bets, bets on side-bets, and bets on bets on side-bets. Each of these carry their own risk profiles but are ultimately tied to that first $1.\n\nThe thesis here is the sheer quantity of the value of side bets changes how the initial bet plays out.\n\nIt's similar to the reflexivity principle discussed by George Soros in his book the Alchemy of Finance (read my review here) or the concept of Gary as described by TV-friendly market maker and fund manager Cem Karsan. GO INTO DETAIL ON GARY HERE AND LINK SQUEEZE PAPER\n\n## Reflexivity: The Observer Effect\n\nPhysicists deal with the same issues of reflexivity as financial markets, but in a more fundamental sense — the observer effect.\n\n\"In physics, the observer effect is the disturbance of an observed system by the act of observation. This is often the result of instruments that, by necessity, alter the state of what they measure in some manner. A common example is checking the pressure in an automobile tire; this is difficult to do without letting out some air, thus changing the pressure. Similarly, it is not possible to see any object without light hitting the object and causing it to reflect that light. While the effects of observation are often negligible, the object still experiences a change.\"\n\nFinancial markets are dynamic entities with an infinitely complex combination of observers and their intentions. This observer effect is compounded through the use of derivatives.\n\n## Crypto Market Structure\n\nThings are slightly different in crypto.\n\nThe whales in the equity markets are traditionally risk-averse like endowmnets, pension funds, and even market makers while the whales in crypto are often early adopters playing with house money, emerging funds, or individual traders with a large risk tolerance. I go into more depth on this risk tolerance in Easy Money \u0026 Veblen Goods.\n\nThese dynamics create sustained volatility unmatched in traditional equity markets, aside from perhaps penny stocks or OTC stocks where market caps are small, and majority share owners can, at least temporarily, get away with acting shady to pump or dump prices.\n\n## So, which is the real underlying asset?\n\nIts hard to tell and in crypto, it's definitely not clear. Crypto derivatives are relatively niche compared to equity derivatives, and their notional value is far lower. The existence of multiple crypto futures exchanges, funding rates, on-chain activity and other factors muddy the answer.\n\nFor example, there have been times when Bitcoin futures traded 10% higher on Coinbase than on other exchanges. This doesn't happen to SPX futures on the single exchange (CME), where all /ES futures contracts are traded. Bitcoin's premium has been as high as 20% in South Korea due to restrictions on foreigners trading the South Korean Won — it eventually gets arbitraged out or resets to equilibrium, but that is a non-existent phenomenon in equity markets and shouldn't happen.\n\nThe lack of standardized futures contracts and the use of many different price oracles in cryptocurrency markets creates a complex and uncorrelated web of price data that has yet to be demonstrated to have the same impact on crypto spot transactions as in traditional markets.\n\nAs crypto derivatives markets mature, will they become as reflexive as equity markets?\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    Having the ability to go long or short an asset:\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eLong = You buy the asset and make money when the price goes up\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eShort = You sell the asset and make money when the price goes down\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    Understanding market structure:\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eNumber and size of buyers and sellers\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eCompetition level and information availability\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eRegulatory environment\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"20:[\"trading\",\"crypto\"]\n21:{\"src\":\"/images/derivatives-0.webp\",\"alt\":\"Derivatives vs Spot\"}\n22:T24a6,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\nA concise summary of how crypto wealth has influenced economic behaviors, particularly around Veblen goods—luxury items that become more desirable as they get more expensive. From NFTs to gas fees, crypto markets are driven by psychology and perceived value.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nWith a low of $0.00099 https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/price/ and an all-time high of $68,958.00 https://calendar.bitbo.io/price/, Bitcoin increased in value by 6,965,454,545.45% between 2010 and 2021—just a casual 69,654,545.4545x. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been raised to support the burgeoning blockchain industry, and cryptocurrencies have surpassed $3.3 trillion in total market capitalization at their peak. According to Chainalysis, over $160 billion https://x.com/zacharyr0th/status/1517988266569523201 in crypto gains was realized in 2021 ($76.3b in ETH, $74.7b in BTC, and $11.7b in all altcoins). It's easy to understand how many millionaires and billionaires were freshly minted during this time. All this money needs to go somewhere.\n\nThe newest money crowd wields newfound power that wasn't possible until a few years ago. Blockchains and non-custodial wallets let anyone take full control of their financial assets in an unprecedented practice known as self-custody. Assets are no longer custodied by banks or investment firms; rather, they remain decentralized, on-chain assets globally trading in liquid markets 24 hours a day. The ability to 100x or -100% on a portfolio has never been easier.\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchain technology have relatively higher barriers to entry than traditional finance, which is already a convoluted subject to understand. Between developers, entrepreneurs, traders, venture capital funds, hedge funds, quantitative trading firms, and absolute beginners, informational asymmetry levels can continuously be exploited as new participants and unaudited protocols enter the market. As a result, there are always opportunities for more money to be made.\n\n## Where Will All This Money Go?\n\nNow that it's clear there is a lot of crypto money out there, and it has to go somewhere, consider the anthropological and psychological aspects of what blockchain technologies are enabling. NFTs, DAOs, airdrops, and on-chain governance are bringing people worldwide together to work towards similar goals or participate in incentivized networks and communities.\n\nThis, along with the newfound generational wealth, results in several exciting behaviors between groups of strangers.\n\n## Normal Goods \u0026 Discretionary Spending\n\nEveryday goods are purchased more often when incomes rise, and discretionary spending refers to purchasing non-essential items.\n\nBelow are some examples of discretionary spending on everyday goods.\n\n- Buying the newest iPhone when your current one works fine\n- Buying an expensive latte machine when your drip coffee maker works fine\n- Going on vacation\n\nMost high-quality items are normal goods. Inferior goods, on the other hand, are items that you buy less of as your income rises. These are usually cheap substitutes for normal goods like knock-off clothing brands and low-quality food.\n\n## Veblen Goods, Luxury Items, \u0026 Mimetic Desire\n\nWhen you reach the high end of the price spectrum on normal goods like cars, clothes, pens, watches, NFTs, etc., rules change. These normal goods turn into something else entirely – Veblen goods. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/veblen-good.asp\n\nVeblen goods are items that get more valuable as their prices increase.\n\nThink about the white cotton T-shirt from TJMaxx that sells for $5 and compare it to the white cotton T-shirt from Prada that sells for $500. While there may be negligible differences in material, the Prada insignia is on the Prada shirt. With that insignia comes clout and cultural significance. Prada stands for something cool, and anyone who wears Prada is cool, right?\n\nThis type of social engineering is a large part of what drives the prices of luxury items skyward, and NFTs are a prime example. A long list of reasons drives people to NFTs, but very often, it is either for the idea of buying something for X and selling it to someone for X+Y, the concept of being and owning a part of a community, or both. So, how can you value an NFT or a set of NFTs? If you ask many of the most successful crypto traders, they would tell you to follow the cult.\n\nNotice they aren't recommending you join the cult. Instead, you observe which communities are the most cultish in their behavior and position investments accordingly. This can be carried across cryptocurrencies and NFTs, but it is especially prevalent in NFTs.\n\nNFTs are valued at whatever someone else will pay. If there are 10,000 items in a set of NFTs and 20,000 people want to own one or more of them, that creates an imbalance that can only be resolved with rising prices. People notice the price going up and want to get in on it. This increases the price even more until there is a capitulation event, the average buyer is priced out, and the price starts trending down.\n\nMimetic desire is an interesting way to frame this dynamic.\n\nMany crypto and market publications have discussed this topic at great length, but it's worth exploring to give a sense of how psychological phenomena can drive price action.\n\n### Mimetic Desire\n\nMimetic desire is best explained with an analogy. Imagine you are standing next to someone on a trampoline. That person sees something they want that requires them to jump to reach it. When they jump, you feel the movement of the trampoline underneath you. A natural reaction is to look at where this movement is coming from. When you see the thing that the person next to you wants, the Mimetic theory argues that you'll start to want that thing, too.\n\nLearn more about it here. https://read.lukeburgis.com/\n\nBaby behaviors are often used to describe the effects of mimetic desire. If you observe a room of 5 babies and five toys, the first baby that grabs the first toy will make that first toy an object of desire for the other four babies. All of a sudden, the other four babies will want that particular toy for themselves even though four perfectly available toys are lying around the room.\n\nGiven the previous examples, the final one is ironic – markets are bastions of mimetic desire.\n\nWhy do people flock to gold when financial times get rough and when more rare earth metals are out there? Why are people buying 3 million dollar images of cartoon apes when other cartoon NFTs are out there?\n\nIn short, because other people are doing it.\n\n## Ethereum'sEthereum's Gas as a Veblen Good\n\nOne can argue that even Ethereum's transaction fees have become a Veblen good.\n\nA quote of $7,287.36 for a transaction fee.\nGiven that most entrants in NFTs are, on average, newcomers to crypto and that newcomers typically value UI/UX and low fees over decentralization, why are the most expensive NFTs on Ethereum when other chains like Avalanche and Near offer just as adequate onboarding experiences and lower fees?\n\nAn answer could be that Ethereum is the original Turing-complete Infinite Machine or that only people who can afford to transact on Ethereum can own Ethereum NFTs. Unless you are in it for the relative decentralization—which many are not—trading on Ethereum can now be considered a Veblen act since there are cheaper options to deploy and purchase NFTs.\n\n## In Conclusion: It's All Psychology\n\nWhen economies bust, discretionary spending goes down. When economies boom, some normal goods transform into Veblen goods. As prices go higher, people notice. As people notice, more people buy, and prices balloon even higher—until they don't.\n\nIf BTC is up 5%, some people will buy, but many will feel like they'll have a chance to buy at a similar price later, so they don't have to buy now. If BTC is up 20%, these same people may feel like they won't be able to pay less than the current price, so they buy now. The same goes for selling.\n\nThere are 2nd and 3rd order effects to every decision. Basing your trading decisions on how you perceive other people will react will place you one step ahead of the traders simply reacting. Then, take a step back and think about basing your trading decisions on how you perceive how other people will perceive other people reacting.\n\nThen take another step back… and another …\n\nMicro and macro versions of this phenomenon occur every moment in crypto'scrypto's 24/7 markets.\n\nIt's fractal.\n\nThere is endless FOMO and endless opportunities to get rekt, but there are also infinite possibilities.\n\nSolflare is here to help you through this journey by allowing you to securely open decentralized bank accounts and investment accounts—AKA blockchain wallets—on the world's highest-performing blockchain.

The path of least resistance is not always the most straightforward or most secure, and a handful of incumbent kernel architectures will dominate the market in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn the meantime, there is plenty of room for innovation in the kernel design space. I'm most interested in multi-layered kernel designs that can provide the performance of a monolithic kernel with the security and modularity of a microkernel. There may also be a demand for kernels specifically designed for a real-time data processing use case, such as high-frequency trading or blockchain validation.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"26:[\"tech\"]\n27:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"Kernel Access\"}\n28:T1ae0,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nLiquidity pools enabled new forms of decentralized finance by eliminating the need for market makers, providing liquidity to otherwise illiquid markets, and offering new yield-generating opportunities.

Buyers aim to pay the least, while sellers seek the highest price, creating a spread between them. When trading, users place limits or market orders, which are executed at the best available price.\n\n### Liquidity Pools\n\nLiquidity pools, in contrast, operate on different principles. They are smart-contract-based token reserves that enable decentralized trading and yield generation. Liquid pools offer several advantages over traditional order book systems by automating the trading process and removing intermediaries.\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eBenefit\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eDescription\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eContinuous Liquidity\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003ePools provide constant liquidity, allowing trades to occur anytime without relying on matching buyers and sellers.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eSimplified Trading\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eUsers can swap tokens directly against the pool, eliminating the need to navigate complex order books.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eYield Generation\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eLiquidity providers earn fees by depositing assets into the pool, creating new passive income opportunities.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMarket Accessibility\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003ePools enable trading for less popular or new tokens that might struggle to maintain liquidity in traditional markets.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n## The Issue with CLOBs\n\nA typical central limit order book (CLOB) contains a labyrinth of intermediaries lurking beneath this seemingly efficient system. Traditional finance (TradFi) or centralized finance (CeFi) is a bureaucratic beast, requiring a small army of entities to execute a single trade. We're talking centralized exchanges (CEXes), market makers, deep-pocketed prime brokers, custodians, and others. This complex web creates a financial fortress with sky-high entry barriers and rampant information asymmetry.\n\nImagine you're looking to buy 150 Apple shares for $130 each, but there are only 50 shares up for grabs at that price, and the next batch is waiting to be bought at $131. Enter the market maker. These financial intermediaries conjure up liquidity and will happily provide those extra 100 shares, but don't expect charity - you'll be paying a premium for the privilege of accessing that trade at that exact moment in time.\n\n### Implications of Market Makers\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eImplication\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eDescription\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThe Information Advantage\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMarket makers gain a significant edge through their privileged position in the order book structure.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThe True Cost of \"Free\" Trading\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eWhile platforms like Robinhood tout commission-free trading, there's more to the story.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMarket Distortions\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThe symbiotic relationship between market makers and the broader market can lead to unnatural price movements.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n### Enter Liquidity Pools: A Decentralized Alternative\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eFeature\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eDescription\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eNo Middlemen\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThey operate without the need for traditional market makers, cutting out intermediaries.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eDemocratized Liquidity Provision\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eAnyone can become a liquidity provider by depositing tokens into a smart contract.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eAutomated Trading\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eSwaps occur directly with the pool, governed by smart contracts.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eProportional Rewards\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eLiquidity providers earn fees in proportion to their share of the pool.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eFlexibility\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eProviders can exit by burning their LP tokens to reclaim their share of the pool plus accumulated fees.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n## The AMM Formula: A Financial Balancing Act\n\nAt the heart of liquidity pools lies a deceptively simple formula: \\( x \\* y = k \\)\n\n- \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) represent the quantities of two tokens in the pool.\n- \\( k \\) is a constant that represents the pool's total liquidity.\n\nThis formula ensures that as one token's quantity decreases, its price increases, maintaining a delicate balance within the pool.\n\nAny price discrepancy between the pool and external markets creates an arbitrage opportunity. Bots and savvy traders pounce on these differences, ensuring the pool's prices align with the broader market.\n\n## Risks\n\nLiquidity pools allow users to trade trustlessly on decentralized exchanges (DEXes) with nothing more than a non-custodial digital wallet but to be clear, DeFi is still an experimental technology at scale, and venturing into it exposes you to new, unavoidable risks.\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eRisk\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eDescription\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eSmart Contract Bugs\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eEven audited contracts can harbor nasty surprises.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eAdmin Key Risk\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eToo much-centralized control can put your assets in jeopardy.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eSystemic Risk\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eFrom blockchain failures to stablecoin de-pegging, systemic shocks loom large.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eImpermanent Loss\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003ePotential loss from price fluctuations of assets in a liquidity pool compared to holding them outside the pool.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite these challenges, liquidity pools represent a powerful alternative to the fee-laden, opaque world of traditional finance.

This hierarchical structure ensures that a single mnemonic phrase can generate an extensive array of wallet accounts, always producing the same sequence when input.\n\n1. Mnemonic Phrase: The root of the hierarchy\n2. Private Keys: Derived from the mnemonic phrase\n3. Public Keys: Generated from private keys\n4. Wallet Addresses: Derived from public keys\n\n## BIP: Standardizing Mnemonic Phrases\n\nThe concept of mnemonic phrases was introduced and standardized through Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), specifically BIP39. These proposals have had a lasting impact on the cryptocurrency ecosystem, with many other blockchain networks adopting similar standards, including Ethereum and Solana.\n\n## How Mnemonic Phrases Work\n\n1. Generation: A wallet creates a random sequence of words from a predefined list.\n2. Conversion: The phrase is converted into a binary seed through key stretching.\n3. Key Derivation: The seed generates the master private and subsequent child keys.\n4. Address Creation: Public keys and addresses are derived from these private keys.\n\n- Human-Readable: Easier to record and remember than long strings of characters.\n- Versatility: A single phrase can access multiple accounts across various cryptocurrencies.\n- Security: Properly stored phrases provide robust protection against unauthorized access.\n\nPhysical Storage: Write the phrase on paper or engrave it on metal; avoid digital storage.\nMultiple Copies: Store copies in different secure locations to prevent loss.\nConfidentiality: Never share your mnemonic phrase with anyone.\nVerification: Regularly verify the integrity and readability of your stored phrase.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### Private Keys\n\nA private key is a unique code granting access to a digital wallet containing cryptocurrencies or NFTs. It's comparable to a safety deposit box key or email password. Access is typically through mnemonic phrases or keystore files.\n\n### Public Keys\n\nPublic keys are associated with blockchain accounts and digital wallets. They're used as addresses for receiving tokens, similar to email addresses for receiving messages.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### The BIP-39 Process\n\nEntropy – or randomness, is encoded in multiples of 32 bits. A bit is a single unit of information with a value of 1 or 0. The bits are split into groups and are then encoded with a number ranging from 0-2047. These numbers are cross-referenced with a word list, and a mnemonic sentence is born. This sentence is converted into a mnemonic seed phrase using the PBKDF2 hash function, which helps reduce the effectiveness of brute-force attacks. For a more detailed explanation of this process, refer to BIP-39's documentation.\n\n### BIP-32 \u0026 BIP-44\n\nUsing elliptic curve cryptography, one can calculate a public key without revealing the private key. The single private key can also generate a nearly infinite set of public keys, each accessible by various derivation paths required for a wallet to hold more than one token.\n\nFor most users, accessing more than a digital wallet's recommended derivation path is unnecessary. Most wallets' user interfaces either do not require a derivation specification or give users the option to choose which derivation path to access—often with the option to select a recommended path.\n\nEach token has its derivation path. If users were required to access each asset in a multi-asset wallet individually, this could become cumbersome. Instead, BIP-32 introduced the ability of a single private key to unlock more than one public key.\n\nBIP-44 defines the specific hierarchy to use as described by an algorithm detailed in BIP-32. This means that different derivations of a wallet will comply with the following format:\n\nm/purpose'/coin_type'/account'/change/address_index\n\nHierarchical deterministic wallets are identified with the BIP-44 reference under purpose'.\n\nFor example, m/44'/60/' 0'/1’/8′ = The 9th address at change level 1 (addresses begin at 0).\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nBefore BIP-32, burdensome tasks and financially insecure practices regarding digital wallets and derivation paths prevented many people who needed to be computer-savvy from participating.\n\nOnce BIP-32, 39, and 44 were widely implemented, users could access nearly a limitless number of digital assets (tokens and NFTs) from one user-friendly mnemonic device. Thank BIP-32, 39, and 44.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n### Core BIP Documentation\n\n- [BIP-32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) - Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets\n- [BIP-39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki#Generating_the_mnemonic) - Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys\n- [BIP-44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) - Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets\n- [BIP-39 Word Lists](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md)\n- [English Word List](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt)\n- [Chinese Word List](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/chinese_simplified.txt)\n- [From Mnemonic Phrase to Address](https://blog.mycrypto.com/the-journey-from-mnemonic-phrase-to-address)\n- [PBKDF2 Hash Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2)\n- [Brute-force Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack)\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2c:[\"crypto\"]\n2d:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"Mnemonic Phrases\"}\n2e:T10d9,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nI'm building MusicIDE, which will directly incorporate advanced music theory and LLMs into a Cursor/Musescore/Synthesia-like software.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nWith the advent of LLMs and AI wrappers, the barriers to entry in the world of technology are breaking. As Chamath put it, the future will not be governed by people who are good at memorizing things and manually doing laborious computations but rather by tastemakers. Tastemakers know what they want because they've seen what they don't. Unfortunately, when money gets involved, sellouts become a problem. True tastemakers create trends and drive innovation by sticking to their actual tastes rather than catering to their corporate sponsors or audiences. In other words, the more personal something is, the more universal it is.\n\n### Notation Landscape\n\nDominant notation software like Sibelius is limited, static, and requires meticulous attention to detail throughout every step of the process. To substitute a Db Neopolitan 6 chord in first inversion across 18 instruments for the dominant chord in a symphonic score, the chord must be diagnosed, and each note must be inputted individually across the instruments. Editing this on paper is one thing, but in a notation program, it's so annoying. Keyboard shortcuts and MIDI input help, but we need more.\n\nWith MusicIDE, a goal is to be able to prompt the system to do this in the same way that Cursor does - to generate and apply all the changes while giving me the option to further edit the changes before accepting them. This tool will know that you're in the key of C and will generate a Db chord with an F in the bass. To do that, it needs to understand what a Neopolitan chord is, what the six means, what the notes are in every key, and be able to substitute the current notes for the new ones across all the instruments. Traditionalists will say this is blasphemy, and they have a point but this isnt traditional music composition.\n\n### Generated Music?\n\nHow will all the other notes be input? Will there be parallel 5ths that bring horror to every music teacher in the hearing distance? Will appogiaturas be considered? Does the counterpoint make sense? Why is this note here instead of there? These are valid questions and should be considered because every choice matters in music, but non-determinism has been thoroughly investigated in the realm of composition and, in some sense, having the voicing/counterpoint/music/etc. being generated is just an extension of the non-deterministic outputs famous composers have used for over a century. We don't know precisely how these AI models work, so we can't predict their exact output - for better or worse.\n\nGenerated is the right word to use, but MusicIDE is going to be much more than a generative AI wrapper. It will also feature exhaustive permutations of music concepts and references to historical examples of those concepts. This can help accelerate learning, researching, and writing music in ways that will be easier to explain in future articles once demos are made available.\n\n### Applications\n\nThe overarching goal is to aid individuals in Music Research and Composition by giving everyone the compositional and analytical tools that history's greatest musicologists, musicians, and composers have been working with.\n\nThis means every open-source score, textbook, concept from music theory, and analytical resource can be built into the program to be used as context for learning, researching, and composing music. The longer-term roadmap for MusicIDE includes tools to learn music on the instrument of your choosing with the help of AR and guitar-hero-inspired visuals for the piano.\n\nIts important to emphasize that while AI is useful for generating templates, boilerplates, ideas, and implementations of ideas - ultimately the choices of AI-assisted composers is by the human - the tastemaker.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2f:[\"music\",\"ai\"]\n30:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"MusicIDE\"}\n31:T176f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n    Non-custodial wallets give you complete control over your assets through private keys that only you can access. Unlike exchange wallets, they can't be frozen and give you abilities many can only dream of, but you're responsible for keeping your login info safe. \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nCrypto wallets come in all sorts of shapes and sizes and non-custodial wallets give you, and only you, control over your private keys. A private key is a secret code that your wallet uses to log in and verify cryptocurrency transactions you send from your wallet. These keys are governed by mathematical functions that prove the funds are yours and that no one else has access to or can recover them.\n\nThis contrasts with custodial wallets, which require creating an account through a centralized exchange. These exchanges mandate KYC (know-your-customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) verification, requiring you to share sensitive personal information. While major exchanges are regulated and prioritize security, using a custodial wallet means placing trust in their ability to protect both your personal data and your funds. Most custodial wallets also require linking a bank account, giving the exchange visibility into your financial activity.\n\n# Understanding Non-Custodial Wallets\n\n## The Risks of Custodial Solutions\n\nWhen using a centralized exchange, your funds are held in custody by the platform – meaning they control the private keys. History has shown the vulnerabilities of this approach. Even the largest regulated exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, Robinhood) have frozen trading during periods of high volatility, preventing users from accessing their funds.\n\nThe risks extend beyond temporary freezes. Exchange wallets, which hold massive amounts of cryptocurrency, are prime targets for hackers. The Mt. Gox and Quadriga disasters serve as stark reminders – both exchanges suffered catastrophic breaches, resulting in users losing their entire holdings. These incidents gave birth to the crypto community's warning: \"not your keys, not your coins.\"\n\nSuch events undermine confidence in both the centralized crypto ecosystem and traditional finance, as users lose faith in financial intermediaries. While centralized finance relies on trust, these failures have accelerated interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and permissionless systems that eliminate the need for trusted third parties.\n\n## Managing Self-Custody: Security is Key\n\nThe primary risk to self-custody is losing your login information, which would make your digital assets unrecoverable. You can change your password with your mnemonic phrase, but if you forget both, you won't be able to log in again. Being organized early on can save you millions.\n\nThis is why it is imperative to store your wallet passwords and mnemonic phrases in secure, recoverable locations. The best practices are to physically write them down and keep them in encrypted documents on your device—not a cloud-based storage system that can be hacked.\n\nThere are estimated to be well over 3 million unrecoverable Bitcoins—about 20% of the current supply, equating to over $200 billion at current prices. This number may be inflated as it could represent long-term holders, but many suspect most of these dormant funds will be lost forever. Only time will tell exactly how many Bitcoins have been lost or forgotten.\n\nTo many, the benefits of self-custody greatly outweigh the self-imposed risk of forgetting a password and mnemonic phrase. For the first time in history, you can be entirely in control of your finances and participate in global peer-to-peer transactions at any hour of the day without permission from a centralized intermediary.\n\n## Real-World Applications: Remittances\n\nThe most straightforward argument for self-custody is found in the remittance industry. This is also an argument for crypto, but it wouldn't be possible without non-custodial wallets.\n\nStudies have shown that migrant workers in first-world countries spend up to a month's worth of wages to send remittances back home to their families. Low and middle-income country remittances amounted to $466 billion in 2017. Globally, fees averaged 7.45%, or $34.7 billion. 7.45% equates to over 27 days of a worker's annual income. To put the absolute dollar value of these fees into perspective, the US's non-military foreign aid budget was $34 billion in 2017. Crypto fixes this.\n\nThrough non-custodial wallets, users can seamlessly send capital over decentralized networks while paying little to no fees—as long as they're not using Ethereum.\n\nTransacting over Solana is frictionless and typically costs 0.000005 SOL or about $0.001 in transaction fees. Solana and other low-fee blockchains can dismantle the Remittance Service Provider (RSP) industry, which is heavily reliant on banks. In 2017, banks charged an average of 11.18% in remittance fees.\n\n## The Future of Financial Freedom\n\nNon-custodial wallets enable a new level of freedom. You always control your capital while it's in your wallet. You can transact with any other wallet anytime using any compatible cryptocurrency without permission. You also have instantaneous access to the beautiful world of DeFi, where you can pseudonymously participate in cutting-edge financial services and NFT and DAO platforms that you otherwise would not have access to.\n\nIn the same way that bank accounts became safer than holding cash, self-custodying crypto is safer than using a bank – when done correctly.\n\nStore those passwords and mnemonic phrases in secure places.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"32:[\"crypto\"]\n33:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"Non-Custodial Wallets\"}\n34:T1038,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nWhat do NounsDAO \u0026 John Cage have in common?\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nIn 1985, contemporary composer John Cage wrote a solo piano piece called ASLSP (As Slow as Possible) that can last anywhere from 20 to 70 minutes. In 1987, Cage adapted it for organ, and in 2001 - 9 years after Cage's passing, a small German church constructed a customized organ to perform this piece over the next 639 years. The organizers chose this duration as that was the age of the church in question. The most recent notes, G# \u0026 E, were on September 5, 2020, and the next note, G#, will occur on February 5, 2022. The final note will take place on September 5, 2640. There will also be a new Noun auctioned off that day.\n\nNounsDAO is an NFT project built on Ethereum that harnesses time as a method of distribution and decentralization. Each Noun is a generative 32x32 pixel NFT comprising people, places, and things. Their features are chosen randomly and controlled by a smart contract that transfers the Noun to the winning bidder's wallet while simultaneously creating a new Noun for auction 24 hours later. 100% of the auction proceeds are deposited into the NounsDAO Treasury and governed by the collective of Noun NFT holders. At the time of writing, 24 Nouns control 3260.6022 Ethereum ($11,003,847.70 at a current ETH price of $3,374.79).\n\n![NounsDAO](/images/nouns-3.webp)\n\nSince 100% of auction revenue gets deposited into the Treasury, the founders (Nounders) will be gifted every 10th Noun for the first five years.\n\nRather than having a typical centralized command center, NounsDAO intends to enable all participants to have a substantial stake and say in a project's trajectory. With each passing day, the NounsDAO Treasury gets slightly more decentralized, and the previous Noun owners' say gets slightly more diluted.\n\n## On-Chain Features\n\nTo do everything that NounsDAO is doing, you need blockchain technology. Smart contracts govern the distribution and governance of the protocol and proposals to the NounsDAO, which require at least 5% of Nouns to be involved. Proposers can be one person, or it can be a group of people who all own Nouns. With a current average price of 135.86 ETH ($458,493.654), you need at least 679.29 ETH ($2,292,468.27) worth of Noun NFTs to submit a proposal.\n\nThese proposals can be anything from donating to charities to changing the Nouns supply required to submit proposals. Given that this project is barely three weeks old, the community is still new, and the DAO has not had much time to submit and enact proposals.\n\nAlthough they have succeeded in doling out a total of 30 ETH ($101,243.70) to 6 different charities, and you can see that the 30 ETH have been disbursed in the internal transactions tab on the NounsDAO Treasury address on Etherscan. It's too bad governments don't have a public ledger for spending our money.\n\n![NounsDAO](/images/nouns-4.webp)\n\n## Derivatives\n\nBelow, you can see the hand-drawn Improper Noun set. The artist releases a new one daily and can be connected on Twitter here.\n\n![NounsDAO](/images/nouns-5.webp)\n\nHere is a set of paintings designed using the AI process known as GAN. Connect with the Noun GAN Study artist here.\n\n![NounsDAO](/images/nouns-6.webp)\n\n### Its Interesting\n\nThe elephant in the room is that the Nounders and their beneficiaries will have more control over the DAO than they should due to their receipt of every 10th Noun. Maybe a proposal to remove this stipulation will be made, but until then, that's always a risk.\n\nJohn Cage's ASLSP and NounsDAO both have a beginning, but only ASLSP has an end. Does that make Nouns more timeless? Who cares, someone paid 613.37 ETH ($1,848,531.57) for this.\n\n![NounsDAO](/images/nouns-2.webp)\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"35:[\"crypto\"]\n36:{\"src\":\"/images/nouns-0.webp\",\"alt\":\"Nouns\"}\n37:T1edc,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nOther than on crypto exchanges, most of the crypto activity occurs in blockchain applications. Apps are built directly on a blockchain and utilize its settlement layer to perform their functions, which usually take place in centralized databases and cloud services. They can be anything from a messaging service to a trading platform, and on-chain activity refers to transactions occurring across various applications on various blockchains - which all take place permissionlessly.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n# Understanding Blockchain Applications\n\n## Core Components of the Blockchain Ecosystem\n\nThere are thousands of apps built across dozens of blockchains, and most of their utility and function can be categorized into the DeFi, NFT, or DAO industries. Some apps help users earn yields of billions of dollars, while others are built purely to serve as infrastructure, such as bridges between different blockchains. New apps like Lens, an on-chain social network, and Rabbit Hole, an on-chain credentialing service, are gaining popularity, and it will be interesting to see how burgeoning sub-industries like digital fashion and decentralized science movements evolve. They're similar to regular websites but use blockchains, a framework different from the regular internet, so their capabilities differ.\n\n## DeFi: Decentralized Finance\n\nThis is a movement of software developers and financial engineers who are building permissionless and interoperable economic systems across many blockchains. The goal is to increase financial inclusivity while eliminating friction and barriers to entry. The engineering culture is open source and inspiring to many, so there has been unprecedented innovation compared to traditional finance (TradFi), which is full of closed-source systems and legacy infrastructure.\n\n## NFTs: Non-Fungible Tokens\n\nVerifiably unique tokens that represent digital ownership.\nTokens that are not NFTs are many in number. Tokens that are NFTs are one of a kind.\n\n\"There are 21 million fungible Bitcoins in existence.\"\n\nEvery BTC is fungible with every other BTC.\n\nYou can trade 1 BTC for 1 BTC and 6.84 BTC for 6.84 BTC.\n\nNFTs are more like 1:0.5x or 1:10x, where x is the value.\n\n## DAOs: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations\n\nDAOs are an experiment in social governance structures. They intend to offer a more egalitarian and horizontal approach to company formation and community management.\n\nEach DAO serves different purposes and has its own internal processes. The function of most common DAOs ranges from severe use cases like voting on app updates and new developments (like UniSwap) to comedic and viral concepts like pooling funds to buy an NBA team (KrauseDAO).\nDAOs enable token holders to draft proposals to be voted on by the community, like this one for Gitcoin. The infrastructure to do this is a growing field of crypto and is the source of a large amount of developer activity.\n\nDAOs may vote on how treasury funds are managed, which NFT or tokens are invested into, roles and responsibilities within the DAO, and how to handle any internal conflicts that arise.\n\n## The Power of Permissionless Systems\n\nThe idea of asking for permission to make a transaction sounds odd, but 99.9% of the world indirectly asks for it whenever they access their bank account. The other 0.1% participates in DeFi or a barter network.\n\nIn a barter network, you act within a P2P (peer-to-peer) framework with no central intermediary. If I have ten chickens but want one cow, and you have one cow but want ten chickens, and we both value ten chickens per cow, I can trade my chicken to you for your cow, and we'll both be happy. DeFi enables this same P2P framework but in the context of digital assets.\n\nLet's take the DEX example mentioned above. DEXes enable the permissionless transaction of digital assets by implementing liquidity pools. Liquidity pools are effective services governed by on-chain software that facilitate the transfers of liquidity, or on-hand capital, that traders can use to make trades.\n\nNo company and no CEO are involved with any transaction on a DEX, so no company or CEO can stop any transaction. These liquidity pools don't just close at 4 PM ET as the New York Stock Exchange does. They are 24/7 mechanisms that exist as long as the blockchain they are on exists. They are a series of processes, otherwise known as a protocol, and many can exist without human input or monitoring.\n\n### Understanding Liquidity Pools\n\nWhen compared to a CEX (centralized exchange), DEXes are revolutionary. Rather than deal with 5-10 various TradFi intermediaries to handle your funds and trade lifecycles for you, you can do it all on your own. These 5-10 intermediaries cause many issues that make finance less transparent, less democratic, and more counterparty-dependent.\n\nBlockchains aim to eliminate this dependence by serving as immutable sources of record on which other applications, like DEXes, can base their activity. The DEX doesn't have to worry about who's in the custody of your assets because you can only be there unless you lose your mnemonic/recovery phrase.\n\n## Challenges and Considerations\n\n### Regulatory Uncertainty and Counterparty Risk\n\nIn TradFi, your location may restrict you from accessing certain services, like crypto derivatives in the USA. US crypto traders are given a different opportunity than non-US crypto traders, and the reasons behind that are reasonably nuanced. Long story short, US agencies like the SEC are not transparent with their opinions. As a result, crypto exchanges want to avoid getting in trouble in the future, so they generally don't offer derivatives or as many token listings in the US as they do internationally.\n\nThis regulatory framework ultimately hurts US investors, as they are left with a small selection of tokens to choose from and disingenuous public market instruments like an ETF of futures contracts following BTC's price. The regulatory uncertainty also impacts the country's economy as a whole, as developers and other human resources gravitate towards and generate economic value in regions with favorable regulations. This concept, jurisdictional arbitrage, is a growing trend in this digital age. It's an example of a second-order effect of slow and backward policies.\n\n### Reserve Currencies \u0026 Unprecedented Territory\n\nThe global monetary system is inconsistent. Evidence suggests that new international reserve currencies emerge every few centuries. Billionaire investor and Bitcoin advocate Ray Dahlio, among others, theorizes that the USD's current reserve status is declining and that other currencies will rise in global prominence.\n\nWhile compelling, this theory stands in contention with other geopolitical commentators such as Peter Zeihan, who refers to falling populations and supply chain issues halting the advancements of many emerging markets over the next century. Peter argues that the global macroeconomic environment has moved into an unprecedented territory and that the previous framework won't accommodate what will happen. Also compelling.\n\n## The Future: A Digital Renaissance\n\nCrypto is experiencing a digital renaissance. People and companies can now take custody of their financial affairs in ways never imagined. NFTs and DAOs are related to DeFi but are breeding grounds for different forms of innovation and creativity that disrupt incumbent industries like art, real estate, e-commerce, gaming, governance, and investments.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"38:[\"crypto\"]\n39:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"Permissionless Systems\"}\n3a:T1847,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nPerpetual futures are derivative contracts with no expiration date. They track an underlying asset's price through funding rates, where traders pay or receive fees to maintain the price peg. These contracts are secured by collateral and settled directly on a blockchain.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Introduction\n\nPerpetual futures contracts are derivatives. Derivatives are tradable financial instruments that fluctuate in value as a real-time response to an underlying asset's price changes. A trade of the underlying asset itself would be referred to as a spot trade. This underlying asset could be anything that has a verifiable price feed.\n\nFor some perspective, there are estimated to be a few hundred trillion dollars worth of assets in the world and a few quadrillion dollars worth of derivatives.\n\nStandard futures contracts have a set expiration and settlement date. Technically, futures contracts are legally binding documents that ensure the delivery of an asset at a specific price on a specific date. The asset being delivered at expiration could be physical or it could be a cash exchange. Most futures contracts are closed out and cashed out for difference before they reach expiration as only a small portion of traders are looking for physical delivery.\n\nWhen you trade a stock, a market maker is usually providing liquidity for you to trade. There are issues with this as market makers have a large influence on prices. When you trade futures, the exchange itself is the only counterparty. They will settle the trade and either deposit winnings into your account or take losses out of it.\n\nIt is important to understand that futures contracts are leveraged positions. Every time you are making a futures trade, you are borrowing money to do so. Your wins and your losses will be amplified by the amount of leverage you utilize.\n\n## Benefits of Using Futures\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    Having the ability to go long or short an asset:\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eLong = You buy the asset and make money when the price goes up\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eShort = You sell the asset and make money when the price goes down\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eWhen shorting, you are selling X at Y price with the intention of buying back at a lower price of Y-Z\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eShorting requires borrowing money, secured by collateral in your account\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    Traders can utilize leverage for capital efficiency:\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eWhen done successfully, leverage trading can yield much higher returns\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eCan easily lead to blown accounts for inexperienced traders\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    Traders can hedge effectively:\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eExample: Long 10 SOL but expect short-term decline?

If a position is opened, it can be held in perpetuity unless the price goes so far in the opposite direction that the position is liquidated.\n\nLiquidations, which also exist in standard futures, are when your position is automatically closed and the money you used to open it is lost. This occurs when the ratio of how much money you used as collateral falls below the amount of money needed to maintain your position.\n\nAll of these details are emphasized in most futures trading interfaces like the one below. You will usually see a liquidation value meaning if the price were to get to that point, your position would be liquidated.\n\n## Funding Rates\n\nAs mentioned above, futures contracts move in tandem with the spot price of an asset. This spot price is just the open market price. In order for this peg to be maintained, a funding rate is implemented. Funding rates are fees that are paid from one side of a trade to another. For example, if the futures contract is worth less than the spot price, then short positions will pay long positions a fee and vice versa.\n\nAs prices go up, it becomes more expensive to hold a long position and the same goes for short positions when prices go down. Because of this, it is more advantageous for traders trying to take a long-term futures position to use standard futures as there are no funding fees.\n\nAs you can see in the chart above, funding rates often follow the price of an asset but it is not always a leading indicator. It is possible to trade perps with the intention of profiting off of the funding rates and many traders attempt to do so.\n\n## Futures in DeFi\n\nAlthough the majority of perp trading takes place on CEXes like Deribit, Binance, and FTX, perp trading has been a feature of DeFi for some time now. Dydx is an on-chain derivative exchange on Ethereum that has significant volume and there are now a number of protocols on Solana that enable perp trading – namely Mango Market, Zeta Markets, and Drift Protocol.\n\nSolana is the world’s highest-performing blockchain. It can withstand more volume than any other blockchain while still maintaining its security, transparency, and speed. The combination of speed and low fees make Solana the perfect environment for futures trading of all kinds, in particular high-frequency trading.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPerps are a relatively new financial instrument that gives traders the ability to easily open leveraged positions and maintain them indefinitely. It is important to understand the differences between perpetual futures and standard futures as there are pros and cons to each depending on what you are trying to do.\n\nFor a more thorough understanding of how you can utilize futures using your Solflare wallet, check out this guide on How to Trade Perps using Mango.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"3b:[\"crypto\",\"trading\"]\n3c:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"Perpetual Futures\"}\n3d:T2456,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\nTo settle something on a blockchain, there must be an agreement – a consensus. This article breaks down some of the dominant consensus mechanisms decentralized networks have adopted, including Bitcoin's Proof of Work, Ethereum's Proof of Stake, and Solana's Proof of History.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nPublic blockchains are networks aiming to settle transactions in an uncensorable and decentralized way. Miners or validators verify transactions through various processes to prevent central entities from controlling the network.\n\nIndividuals and institutions can participate in transactions on these networks through alphanumeric characters denoting one's digital wallet address. When used effectively, these addresses become pseudonymous identities with powers never before seen - and they're only made possible with consensus methods which underly every transaction.\n\n## Proof of Work\n\nIn 1993, Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor developed the concept of Proof of Work (PoW) consensus to fight off denial-of-service attacks (DoS) between networks of computers. DoS attacks drain a computer's resources by infiltrating it with requests for unproductive tasks that override the system. PoW consensus required the predatory computer to provide evidence of work being done (something being computed) to submit any further request.\n\nTaking inspiration from Dwork and Naor and Hal Finney's Hashcash, Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous founder of Bitcoin, adopted PoW as the foundational consensus mechanism for the Bitcoin blockchain. According to Satoshi's Bitcoin White Paper, PoW combined with a decentralized peer-to-peer network would fix the double-spend issue without relying on a centralized third party. To verify transactions, Miners use computing power to solve cryptographic computations (very complex math problems) and are rewarded with Bitcoin for solving them successfully.\n\nSome argue that PoW consensus secures decentralized networks more than any other consensus method because of the vast amount of work required to overthrow a network, especially since the work becomes more complex as more blocks are mined. With more work needed to secure the network, only those with enormous computing resources can do so, which requires massive energy. This has become a point of contention among environmental advocates as Bitcoin's annual energy usage can be compared to that of a small nation. However, over 50% of Bitcoin's American miners use renewable energy sources.\n\nAlong with the environmental impact, the energy required to secure the Bitcoin network creates high barriers to entry that need to be addressed by the principles of decentralization. Sunny King and Scott Nadal introduced Proof of Stake in 2012 in an attempt to lower these barriers.\n\n## Proof of Stake\n\nProof of Stake (PoS) protocols select validators based on the number of their cryptocurrency holdings and enable them to secure decentralized networks without needing to consume vast amounts of energy. Validators operate nodes, similar to miners, and this model replaces work with a financial stake. As more tokens are delegated to a miner who stakes them, the miner becomes more trustworthy in the eyes of the network. Variations and hybrids of PoS chains involve everything from PoW aspects to delegated and non-delegated validators.\n\nDelegation is a powerful choice for the staker. The structure of how validators verify transactions directly impacts the staking rewards, transaction speed, fees, and throughput of a blockchain. Different blockchains have different Nakamoto Coefficients, which represent their levels of decentralization. Choosing to delegate to the most powerful or profitable validators may present a problem if they want to take control of the network.\n\nAlthough PoS has presented many improvements to the PoW protocol, there are some critical drawbacks. Namely, tracking time and a validator or group of validators holding 33% or more of the delegated tokens can conspire to compromise the network.\n\nAmong seven other innovations to PoS presented by the Solana blockchain, Anatoly Yakovenko's Proof of History (PoH) concept is the solution to telling time while remaining within the confines of a decentralized network.\n\n## Proof of History\n\nPoH utilizes Bitcoin's SHA256 algorithm to maintain a consistent time-tracking system within the confines of the decentralized blockchain. SHA256 is a variation of SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), developed by the National Security Agency (NSA), and is a powerful encryption mechanism. Once data is encrypted using SHA256, the only way to obtain it is by possessing what's known as a key.\n\nUsing a high-frequency recursive verifiable delay function (VDF), PoH imprints a unique hash and count for each transaction and event to the Solana blockchain. Once you know this for a given event, you can figure out what had to occur before and after it. This VDF function enables validators to reconstruct the order of events and serves as a cryptographic timestamp while ultimately enabling unparalleled speed and throughput. VDFs and PoH help more events to happen more quickly.\n\n### Power \u0026 Speed\n\nSolana is the first hybrid of PoS and PoH consensus. When you look at Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, Avalanche, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, etc., the numbers of transactions per second (tps) and verifiable throughput come nowhere close to Solana.\n\nVisa and Mastercard are the preeminent leaders in centralized transactions per second. Credit card purchases can reach up to ~60,000 transactions per second during the holidays. For perspective, Bitcoin can theoretically handle about 15 tps, Ethereum 30 tps, Cardano 300 tps, Avalanche 4,500 tps, and Solana 710,000 tps.\n\nDue to 400 millisecond block times and its unique understanding of time, the Solana blockchain can theoretically handle 710,000 tps as computing power increases. This limit has not been met as computers are not near that efficiency level, although Solana has reached upwards of 400,000 tps on a single node in a test net and regularly encounters thousands of tps on its mainnet.\n\n\u003e Today the @solana SLP \"soft-launch\" testnet went live\n\u003e\n\u003e 🌎 operated by 40+ independent #validators\n\u003e ⚡️ ~500ms breakneck speed blocktimes\n\u003e 🔥 A similar network saw Ø transaction rates of 9k TPS with max bursts up to 60k TPS\n\u003e\n\u003e Those are NOT theoretical claims but real world results 💪\n\u003e\n\u003e — Staking Facilities (@StakingFac) January 17, 2020\n\n### Can it go faster?\n\nMaybe.\n\nGigabits refer to the bandwidth an operating system can receive and transmit. According to Solana's Docs, this 710,000 tps metric is based on a standard single gigabit network. If network bandwidth rises to 10G, Solana can theoretically handle over 454 million transactions per second.\n\nAll else equal, if bandwidth reached 100G (terabits per second), Solana's tps would reach 4.5 trillion. Unfortunately, all else is not equal. Various factors impose limitations, as described by ByteSizeCapital here.\n\n\u003e In terms of CAP theorem, @SolanaLabs favours:\n\u003e\n\u003e 1. Short term -\u003e Consistency over availability\n\u003e 2. Long term -\u003e Availability over consistency.\n\u003e\n\u003e Users have time to choose the \"right\" partition without compromising the PoH \u0026 can be sure the network resumes sometime in the future.\n\u003e\n\u003e — NM (@ByteSizeCapital) May 5, 2018\n\n## Potential\n\nGiven the power Solana's blockchain enables, high-frequency trading firms and marketplaces could adopt it as their fundamental foundation layer.\n\nIt's hard to say how 710,000 (or more) transactions per second will be used in the future, but you can be sure it will change things. Games like Star Atlas could then enable play to earn (P2E) metaverses with extremely high transaction volumes, decentralized investment platforms like Solrise will be able to democratize finance at scale, and messaging services like Bonfida's Jabber can decentralize and harbor virtually any amount of conversation. At the same time, DEXes like Raydium will be able to withstand more trades than any exchange ever before. Of course, the best use cases have yet to be thought of.\n\nValidators are the primary risk to PoS networks. They are held accountable for their actions through slashing but still present a potential threat. To secure the network's future, Solana must keep propagating innovation across its ecosystem while continuing to iterate on decentralization tactics and their newfound technological breakthroughs.\n\nThere's a joke in the Solana community that a Solana Developer with substantial experience has about six months of experience building on Solana. The blockchain was conceived in 2018 and has raised hundreds of millions in funding, but its staggering growth in development and interest has only accumulated over the past year. The roadmap is to attain as much speed and throughput as possible, and the sky's the limit for its application.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"3e:[\"crypto\"]\n3f:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"Proof of History\"}\n40:T1ed9,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nLLMs introduce a new form of search. They can answer questions, provide summaries, and\ngenerate content based on learned data. They're the first real challenge to Google's\nlong-standing dominance and are sure to cause turmoil in the search engine market in the\ncoming years.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## The AI Gold Rush\n\nIf you have an AI idea that you want to get funded, now is your time to try. VCs have been\npouring billions into AI startups at an accelerating rate for years, and since ChatGPT went\nmainstream in December, the acceleration has been reaching a fever pitch. ChatGPT was the\n[fastest](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/)\nconsumer product to hit 1 million users, and interest in it from the public has only increased.\n\nThere's a meme now that all you have to do to raise money from VCs is build a UI wrapper\naround a ChatGPT function—like an app that gives you customized recipes or helps you code.\nEven [Snapchat](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/27/23614959/snapchat-my-ai-chatbot-chatgpt-openai-plus-subscription)\nis releasing a new chatbot with ChatGPT on the backend. It will soon be refrigerators and\nwashing machines.\n\n![Bing-1](/images/bing-1.webp)\n\nBut as Balaji put it:\n\n\u003e \"Not your API keys, not your AI.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e — Balaji Srinivasan (@balajis) _February 24, 2023_\n\nTech companies are feeling the competition. Google's co-founder, Sergey Brin, came out of\nthe shadows to submit his first\n[request for code access](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/01/31/sergey-brin-code-request-lamda/?sh=751f6a857ce6)\nin years to none other than LaMDa - Google's natural language chatbot.\n\nThis was a natural reaction to the moves Microsoft has been making with Bing. Microsoft's\nCEO Satya Nadella made [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcLw-CNySiA)\nThe position is clear: \"I want people to know that we made them dance.\"\n\n### Let's talk about Bing\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Bing's background,\n[Trung Phan](https://www.readtrung.com/) laid out its\n[history](https://www.readtrung.com/p/bing-a-history-in-7-stories) in his\nnewsletter. Bing now incorporates LLMs into its search engine to answer questions and\nprovide a new, arguably revolutionized, browsing experience. Of course, there are variations\nof this already in the wild, but the fact that the biggest companies in the world are\nadopting this is a big signal. As you can see, with Notion's AI, GitHub's co-pilot, Replit's\nAI, Meta AI, and SnapChat's new chatbot - to name a few- will be significant\ncompetition in the coming years.\n\nSo why is OpenAI valued at\n[$29 billion](https://bdtechtalks.com/2023/01/09/openai-tender-offer/)?\n\nWell, they have the best model for now.\n\n## Public Perception\n\nThe public's reaction is mixed. Some see Sam Altman's vision of the AI-enabled future, and\nothers feel Eliezer Yudkowsky's fears of the unknown. In the past few decades, there have\nbeen stories of individuals who began fearing imminent human extinction due to rapid AI\nprogress. They typically liquidate all their assets and indulge recklessly, only to realize\nthey've acted prematurely a few years later. Others fear it will take their jobs, but it\nremains to be seen which industries will be massively interrupted first. Some AI experts,\nsuch as Lann Yucun, say these models are insufficient at their core, and we need new architecture to\nreach the coveted \"artificial general intelligence\" level of machine reasoning.\n\n![Bing-2](/images/bing-2.webp)\n\nHowever, AI advancement may slow down as it historically has, following the typical S-curve\nof expertise acquisition. ChatGPT, while impressive, still has a known hallucination rate of\n10-20%, making it unreliable for serious consideration in search or medicine. Given the\nnature of S-curves, some speculate that the progress AI has made recently will be the most\nit experiences until the next leap forward in the sweet spot region of the\nabove graph - maybe quantum computing gets us there. This makes sense, given that these\nmodels have been trained on nearly all the public data available. If stagnation occurs,\nwe'll see history repeat itself, as that happened during the AI winters of 1974-1980 and\n1987-1993 after massive leaps forward in the industry took place.\n\n### Unintended Consequences\n\nThe unintended consequences are hard to quantify, but a few are clear. Ted Goya goes into\ndetail on some examples\n[here](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/over-the-course-72-hours-microsofts utm_source=substack\u0026utm_campaign=post_embed\u0026utm_medium=web).\nAnecdotally, Bing has returned strange things to me, including \"I would rather us not have\nthis conversation anymore 😔\" instead of giving me a wrong answer - as ChatGPT, You.com, or\nPoe would. Note the word return - I am not going to anthropomorphize these chatbots. It's\nnot responding to me or talking to me. Prompts are the same as binary code to these things,\nand their entire existence is a compilation of code with emergent properties that stem from pattern recognition.\n\nOn the other hand, observing Bing's use of emojis is uncomfortable 😳.\n\n![Bing-4](/images/bing-4.webp)\n\n### The Future of AI and Search\n\nIn the above interview, Satya clarified that improving Google's search model has been\ndaunting. They are monolithic and, until recently, have had no competition. He sees ChatGPT\nand Bing as the first real competitors of Google's prowess. Combine this with the fact that\nNvidia's CEO went on the\n[record](https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-predicts-ai-models-one-million-times-more-powerful-than-chatgpt-within-10-years/)\nsaying their chips will enable models to be 1 million times the power of current AI models in the next\ndecade. ChatGPT was trained on an estimated 10,000 Nvidia GPUs.\n\nWith Edge and Bing only amounting to a fraction of Google's market share, what do Satya\nand Microsoft have to lose? Every underdog story has a Goliath. This time, it's Google.\n\nIt's easy to forget that all of the recent progress in AI wouldn't have happened without\nGoogle. Transformers are considered game changers in the application of AI models, and all\nof these chatbots were trained on networks that incorporate transformers. Google may speed\nup its historically slow software development cycle and blow everybody out of the water. Or\nmaybe Apple will, or Tesla, or Anthropic, or\n[Buzzfeed](https://hackernoon.com/how-buzzfeed-plans-to-use-ai-to-generate-listicles-and-more-content)\nwill.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nIn\n[1962 speech](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/12/1122375097/space-exploration-jfk-we-choose-the-moon-speech#:~:text=His%20%22We%20Choose%20the%20Moon%22%20speech%20became%20a%20pivotal%20moment,at%20Rice%20University%20in%20Houston.),\nJohn F. Kennedy talked about landing on the moon within a decade. Unfortunately, he didn't\nsee it, but the US landed on the moon in 1969. Soon after, sci-fi became an exciting topic\nin mainstream culture for the first time, space blockbusters dominated the entertainment\nindustry. E.g., Star Wars (1977), Star Trek (1966), Alien (1979), and Stanley Kubrick's 2001\nSpace Odyssey (1968). There's a correlation there.\n\nAt first, AI's most significant societal changes will be on each edge of the barbell,\ninspiration, and fear - similar to Sergey Brin's and Eliezer Yudkowsky's reactions. Then,\nunintended consequences that no one can predict will start happening, and that's where it\ncan get out of hand. I hope humans don't begin marrying chatbots.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"41:[\"ai\"]\n42:{\"src\":\"/images/bing-0.webp\",\"alt\":\"Search Engine Turbulence\"}\n43:T1e83,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n# Self-Custody\n\nSelf-custody has been a fundamental feature of crypto since its inception. While it gives people more control over their finances and sovereignty than ever before, it also gives them more responsibility than they're used to - with some unintended consequences.\n\nA massive ramp-up in education or measures to prevent large amounts of scams and lost recovery phrases must be implemented to onboard billions of users to crypto.\n\nMost crypto users keep their funds on exchanges, transferring accountability to the exchange. Financial contagions begin when large custodians of volatile assets become insolvent. Accounts on Coinbase, for example, are subject to seizure if Coinbase becomes insolvent. In other words, if Coinbase goes bankrupt, the banks will take the money (crypto) from your account to cover their debts.\n\nExchanges will only sometimes act in your best interest, and a government shutdown is always possible. Below is one of the oldest adages in crypto.\n\nNot your keys, not your crypto.\n\n## Security Fundamentals\n\nTo safely enjoy the benefits of a decentralized web and non-custodial wallets, you must remember or retain access to your mnemonic phrase and prevent anyone from knowing it.\n\nSince anyone with the mnemonic phrase can access the associated digital wallet, safeguarding this phrase is of the utmost importance. As mentioned in Self Custody: Part 1, you don't want to store sensitive material on a file in your Google Drive. Not only does Google have access to that, but anyone who obtains your Google password does, too.\n\nThe government could subpoena Google or any cloud provider to access your files with the mnemonic - which is how the money launderers who had $4.5 billion in stolen BTC got caught. Authorities had access to one of the launderers' cloud data providers and found private keys in a plain text file that accessed $3.6 billion of the missing BTC.\n\n### Mnemonic Phrases Best Practices\n\nThe best practices for mnemonic phrases are physically writing them down or etching them into steel and storing them in a safe location. You can keep multiple copies on hand, but be aware of where they are. There are more than a few stories of people obtaining other people's mnemonics, and there are even stories of people forgetting their mnemonics and losing access to generational wealth.\n\n## Digital Identity\n\n### Pseudonymous Identification\n\nIf you're using the internet, you're doing so through a digital medium and utilizing some form of a digital identifier. Everything you do leaves a footprint that details your activity, and it is nearly impossible to evade all the essential cookies and trackers out there. The same goes for crypto, except instead of your activity, location, and behavioral data being tracked and recorded, your transactions are recorded on the blockchain.\n\nEvery transaction you participate in has an immutable digital signature when using a non-custodial wallet. This signature is publicly indexable through various blockchain explorers like Solscan or Etherscan. For every blockchain transaction, documentation of the public keys involved, the transaction hash, the transaction fee paid, and other relevant information exists. Think of each of your public keys as an extension of your digital identity.\n\nThis public information can be analyzed retrospectively to see where and how the current balances came to be. It could also be used to predict what the next activity will be done with a wallet or collection of wallets. Entire businesses, like Nansen, are being built on identifying smart money by analyzing public blockchain addresses using AI to understand their activity. What are the most profitable wallets in the world holding right now? It's publicly available information.\n\nWith a bit of digging (and machine learning), you can easily see the activity and profitability of every public key. Just copy and paste a wallet address or transaction hash into the search bar of any reputable blockchain explorer and incorporate some data analytics.\n\n### Domain Names\n\nNow that it's clear what public keys' utility is and how they enable users to operate pseudonymously, let's go one step further.\n\nYou can buy an NFT composed of keyboard characters representing your public key and, thus, your digital identity. Using Ethereum Name Service on Ethereum or Bonfida's name service on Solana, you can change those scary alphanumeric public keys to something more digestible like Solrise.eth, satoshi.near (on the Near blockchain), or Solflare.sol.\n\nIt can even be 💃.sol – emojis are fair game.\n\nIf your name is Seth and you like Ethereum, you can own S.eth. You get the idea. Instead of sending your friend \"0x329adffe8792930782f\" to pay you back for dinner, they can type in \"S.eth\" as the recipient address.\n\nDomains can simplify transactions, represent digital identities, and host websites.\n\nThey are a relatively nascent field of crypto, so their integration has yet to be applied across the board, and there are some instances where they currently don't work. Most centralized exchanges, at the moment, don't enable you to send tokens to a .eth or .sol address – you'll have to send it to the public key associated with the wallet.\n\n### Pseudonymous Economies\n\nThese pseudonymous digital identities that public addresses and domains can serve enable people to participate in pseudonymous digital economies. Pseudonyms are potent tools many utilize to evade censorship or remove prejudice. If someone's username is Aa97tuhfdfa, there is no religious, racial, nationalist, or prejudicial bias to have about them.\n\nPeople can now have a real-world identity, a pseudonymous identity for communication (whistle-blowing), and a different pseudonymous identity for financial transactions.\n\n## Risks and Challenges\n\nExploits are a problem... [Note: fixed typo]\n\n### The Hard Truth\n\nSelf-custody isn't for everybody.\n\nIf you forget your bank account password, you can call your bank and have it reset. However, if you forget your mnemonic and lose access to your wallet, you won't have anybody to call.\n\nThe future of self-custody is unclear for non-power users. Non-custodial wallets will always exist, but only a portion of the population may use them unless their UX drastically changes. Unfortunately, security is often secondary to user experience, especially for demographics less impacted by the most severe drawbacks of centralized financial systems.\n\nThe custodial wallet model may grow more than the alternative, depending on how regulation develops over the next decade.\n\n## Future Outlook\n\nWhile non-custodial wallets are much more potent than custodial wallets, custodial wallets are getting better.\n\nSome crypto exchanges are beginning to offer exposure and interoperability through DeFi products, a growing part of the industry to watch out for. This is primarily through Earn and Stake products, which generally incorporate traditional lending or sometimes modern DeFi strategies on the backend. DeFi is not allowed in the US, and BlockFi had to pay $100 million in penalties because it failed to adhere to specific compliance disclosures.\n\nAlthough self-custody may not be the right choice for everybody, this course will help you understand the pros and cons of centralized systems and custodial and non-custodial wallets and choose the right option for you.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"44:[\"crypto\"]\n45:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"Self Custody: Part 2\"}\n46:T1ee9,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n# Introduction to Non-Custodial Wallets\n\nNon-custodial wallets are digital wallets like private bank accounts built into a blockchain. They consist of three primary mechanisms: public keys, private keys, and mnemonics. Your wallet can connect to crypto applications like Solrise and Magic Eden.\n\n## Benefits of Non-Custodial Wallets\n\nThe short answer:\nTraditional custodial methods for asset management require at least one counterparty, like a bank. A non-custodial wallet enables you to custody your assets without any counterparty.\n\nThe long answer:\nDecentralized networks only make sense if access to their assets is also decentralized. If blockchains operated in a decentralized fashion while wallets operated using centralized counterparties, many of the benefits of using a blockchain would vanish.\n\n## Real-World Use Case: Remittances\n\nNon-custodial wallets enable digital economies to exist in unprecedented ways. Their significance can be difficult to convey, so let's start with a tangible, real-world example.\n\nWhen migrant workers acquire a visa to work in foreign countries and send money back to their family's home, they send what's called a remittance. This is usually done through Western Union or a large bank with branches worldwide.\n\nLow-income country remittances amounted to $466 billion in 2017. Globally, fees averaged 7.45%, or $34.7 billion. $7.45% equates to over 27 days of an average worker's annual income, meaning low-income migrant workers spent 27 days' worth of their 2017 salary to send money back home. To put the absolute dollar value of these fees into perspective, the US's non-military foreign aid budget in 2017 was $34 billion.\n\nNon-custodial wallets present an alternative solution by enabling permissionless, global capital transfers. If blockchains or blockchain wallets were custodial, the counterparty could stop transactions from happening and require all remittances to be paid through Western Union. Foreign workers are already taking advantage of the low-cost and open nature of cryptocurrencies, and it's one of the most influential and socially impactful use cases for the technology we've seen to date.\n\n## Understanding the Technical Components\n\nPublic and private key cryptography, which is particularly complex, makes non-custodial wallets possible. Like using the internet today, you won't need to understand what's happening under the hood to secure custody of your assets.\n\nAccount abstraction tooling is in the works but for now, you'll need to understand the basics – public, private, and mnemonics.\n\n### Public Keys\n\nPublic keys are wallet addresses. Think of them as your email address. You can send emails to any email address at any time. In the same way, you can send digital assets to any wallet's address at any time – as long as the blockchain you're on is not compromised.\n\nA public key on Ethereum: 0x47bb4cCA98FC49B971d86c5t26562c86E6284CeD\n\nPublic keys are intimidating if you're new to them, but you can copy and paste them when necessary. This one-time copy and pasting is recommended in crypto, as copying and pasting a private key or mnemonic can result in a hacker obtaining it.\n\nEach character of the wallet address, aka public key, is connected to your private key, and if you send digital assets to the wrong wallet address, you will likely be unable to recover them. Wallet designers are continually addressing this issue. If these long alphanumerics are overly intimidating, there's always the option to utilize a custodial wallet at a centralized crypto exchange (like FTX or Coinbase) rather than a non-custodial one (like Solflare or Metamask).\n\nMany wallets have built-in address books, so you won't need to copy and paste a public key every time. Most mainstream crypto exchanges also support this feature. The primary risk of utilizing a non-custodial wallet is either losing your private key or mnemonic/recovery phrase or stealing it. It is crucial to keep a copy of each of those written down and stored safely. Some people etch it into fireproof, \"bullet-proof\" steel.\n\nDon't take a video for social media and accidentally leave your phrase visible in the background. Don't click on any suspicious-looking links—they could be phishing attempts that drain your wallet. This happened to Seth Green, who played Dr. Evil's son in the Austin Powers movie trilogy.\n\nAlso, don't take screenshots of your recovery phrase or private key. Your photos are likely automatically uploaded to iCloud or Google Photos and are subject to risk and seizure by your cloud computing service or federal authorities.\n\n### Private Keys\n\nPrivate keys are more complex to describe than public ones. A private key is an alphanumeric string of characters that gives you access to your wallet.\n\nThink of a private key as a randomly generated password for a specific account that you access with a master password technology like WordPress or Last Pass. The master password, in this case, would be your mnemonic phrase.\n\nA private key on Ethereum looks like E9883D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389F4253213303DA61F20BD47FC233AA332623.\n\nYou won't need to remember your private key and will likely never need to use it directly unless you're a developer. However, access to your private key (via your recovery phrase) is necessary to access your funds.\n\n### Mnemonics / Recovery Phrases / Seed Phrases\n\nA private key allows you to sign transactions for a single wallet account. Recovery phrases, however, give you access to an infinite number of private keys. New wallets can be added to one mnemonic's purview by being imported or generated within the intended wallet's user interface.\n\nMnemonics serve two primary purposes:\n\nThey offer a more human-readable format than a private key, making importing a wallet account into a wallet application easier.\nYou can derive multiple private keys from a single mnemonic phrase, allowing you to create various wallet accounts for different use cases.\n\nIn short, your mnemonic gives you access to your private key, which gives you access to your funds. From the user's perspective, Mnemonics / Recovery Phrases / Seed Phrases are the most essential aspects of a wallet. They are the human-readable sequences of words that give you access to your private keys and, thus, your capital. The words are generally in English, although there are many languages wallet providers can choose to implement.\n\nA public key can easily be calculated from a private key; however, computing the private key from a public key is impossible. Most people are blissfully unaware of their private key(s), which is fine … as long as they are painfully aware of their mnemonic.\n\nA mnemonic phrase looks like this:\n\ndog house safe board room chair table desk computer space flower rain\n\nTo be clear, a mnemonic is not a private key, although if someone were to obtain either your mnemonic or your private key, your digital assets would be compromised.\n\n## The Future of Wallet Technology\n\nCrypto's adoption and accessibility metrics are similar to those of the early internet. Initially, things were overly complicated for the average individual, and generalists ruled the land. To use the internet, you had to know what you were doing. In today's modern internet, you barely need to see what you are doing.\n\nAlthough the Internet initially had massive technical learning curves, once protocols were standardized and the average adult understood how to operate it, it took over.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"47:[\"crypto\"]\n48:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"Self Custody: Part 1\"}\n49:T172c,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nA software update crashed millions of computers on July 19, 2024, causing widespread flight cancellations.\nI was fortunate enough to have booked my flight on this day, and while waiting in the terminal, I started to think about kernels.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nMy flight was luckily only delayed by two hours, but I felt for those whose journeys were more severely disrupted.\nThat sympathy disapated when Delta notified me four hours before my return flight a few days later that they had canceled it.\nThe cause was a widespread failure that affected 8.5 million Windows computers running CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity software that half of\nthe top S\u0026P 500 companies use.\n\n![SFO BSOD](/images/simpleos-2.webp)\n\n## The Incident\n\nAt 04:09 UTC on July 19, CrowdStrike released an update for its Falcon sensor software on Windows systems.\nA defect in this update caused these systems to crash, triggering the infamous Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) which signals that the computer is\nincapacitated and requires a manual reboot.\n\nThe root cause was a problematic modification to a configuration file, Channel File 291, which handles screening named pipes.\nThis led to an out-of-bounds memory read, causing an invalid page fault which was forcefed to each device by an auto-update from CrowdStrike.\nIn simpler terms, the program tried to access memory it shouldn't, causing a crash and this update was forced upon millions of systems, ultimately\nbringing them into a BSOD state and rendering them temporarily useless.\n\nLike many security products, CrowdStrike's Falcon sensor operates at the kernel level to provide robust system protection.\nThis level of access introduces the risk of an application crashing the entire system (or worse) and after that occurred on July 19th and I was\nleft to my own devices in the airport terminal, I started thinking about the variations of kernels out there and what could be done to prevent\nthis from happening again while also realizing I was severely understudied on the topic.\n\n## Kernels\n\nA kernel is the core of an operating system, providing essential services to other programs. There are many different types of kernels,\nincluding monolithic, micro, hybrid, exo, and nano - all with their own pros and cons.\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eType\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eDescription\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003ePros\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eCons\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMonolithic Kernels\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eRun all OS services in kernel space\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eHigh performance, efficient\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eLarge size, potential system-wide crashes\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMicrokernels\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMost services run in user space\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eEnhanced stability and security\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eLower performance\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eHybrid Kernels\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eBalance between monolithic and microkernels\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eOptimized performance and modularity\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eIncreased complexity\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eExokernels\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eGives programs direct control instead of relying on the kernel\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eHigh performance, efficient\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eIncreased complexity\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eNanokernels\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eOffer bare minimum services for hardware management\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMinimal attack surface, highly specialized\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eLimited functionality, not suitable for general-purpose use\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n## Multi-Tier Kernels\n\nBecause of how early I am placed on the Dunning-Kreuger chart when it comes to this topic, I figure a multi-tier kernel architecture can\ntheoretically prevent higher-level applications from having unrestricted access to the kernel, thereby enhancing system stability and security.\n\n- Core OS functions operate at the lowest, most privileged level.\n- Essential drivers and security software run at a slightly higher level with restricted access.\n- Application-level software operates at the highest level with minimal kernel access.\n\nDuring my brief research, I found a [paper](https://faculty.nps.edu/irvine/Publications/Publications2006/NPS-CS-06-001_Analysis3KernelArchi.pdf)\ndiscussing three different multilevel security kernel architectures. The authors rightly conclude that the choice of architecture depends on the\nspecific requirements of a system or deployment scenario and that the goal is to prevent a single issue from compromising the entire system or affecting core OS functions.\n\nOne clear benefit of implementing a multi-tier approach is that you could facilitate a least privilege architecture, potentially limiting the impact of vulnerabilities or bugs,\nsuch as the one in Falcon's Channel File 291.\n\n## SimpleOS: A Prototype Implementation\n\nAfter learning so much about kernels, I decided to prototype one. There is not much to it, but it will be a continuous project. Since this is my\nfirst kernel, I figured I'd make it monolithic in order to understand standard practices. To start, SimpleOS features the following:\n\n1. Monolithic kernel design\n2. Interrupt handling system with custom handler support\n3. Memory management with paging and simple heap allocation\n4. Basic multitasking using round-robin scheduling\n5. Essential x86 structures (GDT, IDT) and initialization\n\nView the full source code [here](https://github.com/zacharyr0th/SimpleOS) and stay tuned for upcoming PRs to SimpleOS and future kernel projects which further explore the multi-tier ideas mentioned above.\n\n![SimpleOS](/images/simpleos-1.webp)\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"4a:[\"tech\"]\n4b:{\"src\":\"/images/simpleos-0.webp\",\"alt\":\"SimpleOS\"}\n4c:T1ad2,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nThe fundamental flaw in blockchain adoption lies in the challenges of on and off-boarding users. The current financial and political infrastructure makes it difficult for people to enter and exit crypto ecosystems easily.\n\nThis limitation, coupled with regulatory hurdles and public skepticism, presents a significant barrier to widespread adoption.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nOnboarding to and offboarding from a blockchain is challenging for first-time users.\n\nThe estimated 30 million developers worldwide are less than 0.5% of the population, meaning 99.5% are technically untechnical in computer science. Blockchains are advanced implementations of concepts in advanced computer science categories, so it's difficult to explain their safety and utility concerns to non-technical individuals. Even technical individuals have their pushback due to ideological differences or disinterest.\n\nBut the problems go deeper than this.\n\n### Onboarding\n\nMany ideas are in progress, but only two well-adopted methods exist for funding a blockchain account, using a CEX or a third-party integration. A CEX is a whole can of worms and requires a KYCd bank account connected to a KYCd centralized exchange that has yet to go under.\n\nThird-party examples include companies like Moonpay and Flexa, which integrate with CEXes and OTC desks to provide users with a quick way to fund their blockchain accounts. These options come with relatively high fees and wide trading spreads, not to mention the censorship built into the flawed and risky KYC/AML procedures that we all must abide by.\n\nI'm not including the option to fund it with another wallet because that wallet would have had to be funded via one of the two options above, which is the chicken-and-egg problem. Validator/Miner rewards may be an exception to this rule, but when you offboard, you run into the same issues listed below that affect everyone else.\n\n### Offboarding\n\nLet's say you onboarded correctly and have USDC in a digital wallet. Now you're financially free and scouring DeFi Telegram channels with the word 'Ape' in their names to find the highest yield for your tokens.\n\nNon-custodial digital wallets embody two concepts we're familiar with - investment and checking accounts. This account you just funded is your investment account, and you collateralize your entire portfolio to leverage long $DOGE. Elon goes back on SNL and says you can buy a SpaceX rocket with it. Shortly after, $DOGE's market cap exceeds $BTC, and you sell at the top. You've 10 times your money, and now, you must withdraw. Once you do, your work life will become optional. #FIRE\n\nIf all goes well, you withdraw from your CEX and then to your bank from the CEX. Your bank happily accepts the transaction because it feels comfortable working with crypto companies like CEXes, given their history of good behavior.\n\nMany things can go wrong during the above process, even if everything goes right on-chain. The on-chain capital is almost unreal unless you're spending out of your blockchain account, which is impossible for most purchases yet. Maybe you could get an IRL loan for on-chain assets, pseudonymously purchase gift cards, or do an IRL/P2P exchange in a crypto-friendly SEZ, but that won't be realistic for most people.\n\n### Censorship\n\nIf you understand the financial plumbing behind both of the above options, you can appreciate how flawed the idea of monetary sovereignty is from a censorship perspective. Suppose the US wants to stop 95% of crypto traffic within its borders. In that case, it must block all bank transactions with centralized exchanges and prevent individuals from transacting with vendors like Moonpay and Flexa. That is a significant problem for those who believe in the ethos behind blockchain technology, and there is no clear or scalable solution.\n\nIn a world where all blockchains are made illegal by the US and others, there will likely be fringe blockchain users and governments that are not trying to compete with first-world capital controls. This 5% estimate is based on the industry's disproportionate number of technical people - let's say 10x more than most industries - compared to the ~0.05% resulting from sampling the general population mentioned above. Blockchains want to be like cockroaches, but it's a case-by-case basis regarding how decentralized they are. It's unrealistic to think the technology goes away, but its implementation is not straightforward in the scenarios I'm describing.\n\nThe reality is that DeFi's value depends on your location. If you're not one to care about self-sovereignty or permissionless markets, can trust your banks, and are not trying to speculate, DeFi isn't for you. Currently, the risks far exceed the benefits for people in that position. Blockchain products may still be helpful and fun, but they're only necessary if your location requires them and you prefer a self-custodial alternative to manage your finances - such is the case for many in Argentina, Venezuela, and elsewhere.\n\n## The Fundamental Flaw\n\nBlockchains and what they enable are amazing feats of engineering, but the political and financial infrastructure surrounding them needs to be improved. A blockchain and everything it enables is only as strong as its weakest link, and until further notice, on and offboarding, is its fatal flaw. Until public sentiment, governmental policies, and UX/UI improvements occur (a whole different discussion), it will be difficult to onboard the first billion users that everyone talks about on slide 5 of their pitch decks next to the TAM of whatever market they are trying to disrupt.\n\n### Bridging the Gap\n\nThere's a certain level of speculation involved with every cryptocurrency. It's a technology backed by cryptography whose price follows surface-level factors and whose markets are underdeveloped. Lower-cap coins are manipulated constantly, and due to Bitcoin's mainstream popularity, it's roughly correlated to what the Fed says, just as every other high-beta risk asset is. However, blockchains offer legitimate solutions, and their value is clear to many industries, but it's more than an uphill battle to convince the adversaries.\n\nIn any case, blockchains need to be better understood by the masses. They fix problems many don't even know exist and can create a future that aims to give individuals and businesses a better opportunity at securing capital, managing transactions, and much more.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"4d:[\"crypto\"]\n4e:{\"src\":\"/images/flaw-0.webp\",\"alt\":\"The Fundamental Flaw\"}\n4f:T2307,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nTesting\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\nMost people worldwide have at least one bank account, but millions don't. Being unbanked or underbanked can be very destabilizing because you have to safeguard or carry your assets with you at all times and pay for everything in cash.\n\nAs blockchain technology has developed, anyone can generate a [non-custodial wallet](/writing/non-custodial-wallets), which can serve as a decentralized bank, and an investment account. This eliminates the need for you to trust an intermediary to safeguard and give you access to your funds. In its current form, it's not for everyone, but for many - it's becoming a necessity.\n\nNo one can close your blockchain account, and no one has access to your funds other than you. You are nearly bankless, but you do need to configure on-boarding and off-boarding methods, which may require a bank. While a covetable aspect of a developed society, banking has its issues. This article breaks a few of them down and gets into the problems of being unbanked and the promise of going bankless.\n\n## The Unbanked\n\n![Banking Statistics](/images/misc/placeholder.webp)\n\nThe number of unbanked citizens varies globally, from roughly 0% in countries like Norway and Sweden to over 70% in Morocco. Reasons also vary, but some causes are a lack of trustworthiness in domestic banking institutions and excess poverty. Financially stable countries are generally more banked; however, the US, the \"richest\" country globally, had 22% of its adults unbanked or underbanked in 2019. That's 63 million people.\n\nAnyone who is unbanked is not able to partake in earning interest on deposits, investing in the stock market, paying bills online, purchasing goods or services over the internet, accessing credit, or several other valuable financial activities. There is also the need to use alternative financial services like money orders and prepaid cards, which are inefficient and rack up fees. According to Forbes, \"unbanked and underbanked Americans spent $189 billion in fees and interest on financial products in 2018\".\n\nWhile banking isn't a perfect system, using a good one undoubtedly gives an individual more financial freedom and ability than being unbanked. The problem is that not all banks are good ones.\n\n### Issues with Banking\n\n- Trustworthiness\n\nTrustworthy bank accounts are a luxury in many parts of the world, and even more so in the US, where most bank accounts are FDIC-insured for up to $250,000. If you deposit $250,000 into an FDIC-insured bank account, you can be certain that your money is backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, its military, and its money printer.\n\nNon-US bank accounts are generally trustworthy, although developing countries with their own currencies often experience volatility in purchasing power. This, along with internal political and external geopolitical pressures, can result in what's known as a bank run, where everybody tries to withdraw their money at or around the same time. Due to the global practice of fractional-reserve lending, banks are not holding onto everyone's money simultaneously.\n\nThey are lending it out with interest to make money on your money.\n\n### Fractional Reserve Lending\n\nWhen you deposit money into a traditional checking account at a bank, you'll likely be charged a fee to keep your money with them, and you will not earn interest on your deposit – but the bank will. The bank must ensure that a specific ratio of cash from depositors is kept on hand in case depositors want to withdraw. If this ratio, called the reserve ratio, is 10%, a bank can lend out $9 out of every $10 you deposit.\n\nWhen the bank loans out your $9, they increase the money in the economy by $9. 9 of your 10 dollars are now being used twice. All of a sudden, $10 is $19.\n\nThis debt that borrowers are incurring must be paid back – with interest. In this sense, debt is willing capital to pay off both interest and opportunity costs that the individual is taking. The theory behind fractional reserve lending is that capital creation drives or forces economies to move forward. Is it the real invisible hand?\n\n### Systemic Risk\n\nWhen economies are riding high, fractional reserve lending is a bank's superpower, just as leverage is to your common trader. Problems start appearing once currencies lose their value and too many people try to withdraw their cash simultaneously. Currency failure is a factor because your deposits are just collateral for banks to issue loans. These loans are on behalf of your liquidity, but you are not being rewarded for it – the bank is. When you take out a loan, you borrow another depositor's liquidity. US Treasuries are not much different.\n\nSkeptics often refer to cryptocurrencies as Ponzi schemes, and in some cases, they are correct, although these skeptics usually fail to recognize how the US Treasury system works.\n\nThe US Treasury system works like this:\n\nThe US government spends all its tax revenue and wants to borrow money to keep spending.\nThe US government issues US Treasury notes, bills, and bonds to increase liquidity.\nThese notes, bills, and bonds – treasuries – are I-owe-yous that will be paid back with interest. This interest rate is called the risk-free rate, although that name is misleading.\nTreasuries, like all forms of fixed income, are legal contracts that require buyers to be paid by a certain date.\nPreviously issued US Treasuries must be paid off with interest, so the US government either uses tax revenue or issues new Treasuries to pay off old debts. Usually, they issue new debt.\nNow, let's look at the definition of a Ponzi scheme on the SEC's website.\n\nA Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors.\n\n### Bad Behavior\n\nAside from the global financial meltdown in 2008, caused by Wall Street and the banking system, banks have accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in fines for other bad behavior.\n\nHere's a list of the number of fines that a few banks have paid since the year 2000.\n\nBank of America (US) – $82,737,699,939 over 214 fines.\nJPMorgan Chase (US) – $35,744,240,670 over 158 fines\nCitigroup (US) – $25,450,155,764 over 122 fines\nWells Fargo (US) – $21,340,036,745 over 181 fines\nDeutsche Bank (Germany) – $18,156,533,878 over 59 fines\nUBS (Switzerland) – $16,792,800,910 over 83 fines\nGoldman Sachs (US) – $16,365,468,987 over 44 fines\n\nFinancial services are the most fined industry in the world. Since 2000, there has been over $330,904,834,105 from over 6,000 fines.\n\n### Going Bankless\n\nAs you can see, banking has its issues. Before Bitcoin and non-custodial wallets, the only way to be your own bank was to be unbanked, and as detailed earlier, that also had its issues. Bitcoin, then Ethereum, and thousands of other cryptocurrencies enabled anyone anywhere to open a private bank and investment account on a blockchain without requiring the trust of any third party.\n\nIt's counterintuitive, but you don't want to trust anyone regarding financial services. An ideal blockchain would not require participants to trust each other but rather serve as an operating system for applications to operate trustless and permissionless.\n\nWhat are Non-Custodial Wallets?\n\n[Non-custodial wallets](/writing/non-custodial-wallets) are immutable sources of record for your savings / HODL account. When you deposit money into any custodial account like a bank or centralized exchange, you trust this counterparty to honor your balance and access your funds. You don't have to trust any counterparty when using a non-custodial wallet. The blockchain collectively verifies your balance, and only those with the mnemonic can access a wallet.\n\nThis is why it's so important to understand and safeguard your mnemonic phrase!\n\nhttps://academy.solflare.com/what-is-a-mnemonic-phrase-and-how-does-it-work/\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor the first time in history, individuals can self-custody their own assets. Given that so many people are still unbanked and the banking system has so many problems, many are jumping straight from being unbanked to going bankless.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly evident in Africa and Southeast Asia, with high percentages of unbanked populations and high adoption rates of blockchain technology. As more of the world's unbanked population goes bankless, these individuals will begin to take advantage of the next generation of financial services and markets.\n\nThis will have massively positive ramifications for the future.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"50:[\"crypto\"]\n51:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"Unbanked to Bankless\"}\n52:T3281,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\nThis article is the first in a series of deep dives into Web 1, Web 2, and Web 3. It will examine the history, function, and legacy of Web 1 through the lens of the Strauss-Howe Generational Theory. \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nThe period from 1990-2005 is widely referred to as Web 1 and was defined by the Internet's primary function of content distribution. It preceded Web 2, which occurred between 2005 and 2020 and was characterized by user-generated content. Web 2 still dominates the Internet's format today, but the crypto industry has helped kickstart what is called Web 3, which is defined by user-owned networks. Web 1, 2, and 3's periods blend into one another as scalable innovation takes time.\n\n## Web Eras at a Glance\n\nFor clarity's sake, below is a one-line description of each\n\nWeb 1 = Content delivery networks. (1990-2004)\n\nWeb 2 = Content creation networks. (2004-Present)\n\nWeb 3 = User-owned networks. (2017-Present)\n\n# Strauss-Howe Generational Theory\n\nFor a deeper understanding of the cultural shifts underlying the advancements and applications of the Internet, this series distills a cross-generational perspective through the lens of the Strauss-Howe Generational Theory. The theory details a recurring cycle of generations that introduce archetypes with behavioral traits associated with the period in which they grew up. This series does not argue for the theory's validity but uses it to provide an anthropological angle through which we can view technological advancements.\n\nRather than detail each of the theory's components, the scope of this article will only pertain to the four generational shifts that occur before repeating. Below are descriptions of each generational period and their associated archetypes.\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-1-0.webp)\n\nEach period lasts about 20-23 years; the cycle repeats every 80-92 years. Although proponents of this theory observe its prevalence among all cultures, their study has focused on developments surrounding Europe and the US.\n\n## The Unraveling\n\nThe time period that Web 1 operated within, 1990-2004, coincided with the Unraveling as described in the Strauss-Howe theory. This era of the Unraveling, 1982-2004, began with \"triumphant individualism which drifted to a pervasive distrust of institutions and leaders.\"\n\nThe Unraveling / Web 1 presented a period when institutions were weak, individualism prospered, and society fragmented into many different factions. This perspective is directly connected to the ethos of the early Internet, which was full of idealistic visions of a more democratic and free society.\n\nAttempts were made to crystalize this ethos into the Internet, but they were unsuccessful as larger companies became the dominant digital forces. This centralization of power to a handful of content distribution channels had lasting ramifications on Web 1 and formed the roots for Web 2's monolithic intermediaries to flourish.\n\n## Generational Influences\n\nThe generation born into the era preceding the Unraveling, known as the Awakening, were Nomads. Theoretically, they grew up with a sense of alienation and insecurity due to the tumultuous time period in which they were raised. This, of course, is a generalization, but it highlights an important idea that in contrast to their childhood, Nomads are said to grow up to become practical and resilient adults.\n\nNomads were the prevailing leaders during this period of Unraveling, and they were met with resistance from the up-and-coming Millennial generation, which aligns with the Hero archetype. Heroes grow up to be optimistic and overconfident adults, and some come to wield enormous power, which efficiently describes leaders like Mark Zuckerberg – born in 1984.\n\nThese leaders, who \"move fast and break things,\" eventually became the incumbents in the industries they disrupted during the Unraveling. They then helped re-strengthen institutions through the business models implemented in the Crisis phase, which follows the Unraveling. It's a classic power transfer, and a new generation is gearing up to disrupt these Heroes using innovations from Web 3, but we'll get to that later.\n\nThis contemptuous relationship between Nomads and Heroes and the breaking down and rebuilding of traditional forms of corporate dominance were inherent features of Web 1. They directly influenced how Web 2 has played out. The world became privy to new forms of communication, and suddenly, every company needed a website. This is analogous to the early days of Web 3 when every person and company involved suddenly needed a wallet.\n\n## What Unraveled\n\nThe era directly after World War 2 was known as the High, defined by strong institutions and the homogeneity of ideas. Individuals were convening on how they wanted culture to move forward. Still, by the time US President John Kennedy was assassinated in 1962, this collective idealism was discarded, and burgeoning cultural movements prompted the next era, the Awakening, to begin.\n\nThese movements highlighted issues that those in charge during the High deemed insignificant, such as racial equality, sexual discrimination, and artistic expression. This Awakening period brought these issues to the forefront of public consciousness and began tarnishing the image of sublimity that the US had managed to muster. As you can imagine, individuals began strengthening their convictions while removing themselves from the institutions they used to identify with.\n\nIn summary, the High strengthened institutions through collective idealism; the Awakening introduced issues with the High's inherent infrastructure and empowered individuals to form their perspectives; and the Unraveling broke down and began rebuilding the industries that empowered the High through digital innovation (e.g., the internet / Web 1).\n\n# Historical Context\n\n## Individual Wealth \u0026 Global Supply Chains\n\nThe global stock market experienced unprecedented booms during the mid to late 1980s, creating enormous wealth for specific individuals and prompting the modern age of consumerism.\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-1-1.webp)\n\nThis also aligned with the globalization of supply chains, which enabled the free trade of goods in ways that never existed before. As companies took advantage of the benefits that outsourcing could bring to their bottom line, power began transmitting from domestic networks to a global supply chain layer with complex webs of intermediaries and agendas. This enabled individuals worldwide to figure out new ways to make money and led to a more distributed global economy.\n\n## Distrust, Adaption, \u0026 Obsoletion\n\nOil and gas, agricultural, tobacco, and auto manufacturing companies were continuously caught lying during the Awakening. The phenomenon of news anchors acting as talking heads with subjective takes on world events was taking over the airways instead of objective journalism. This caused unprecedented divides between viewers of different news outlets, and the public began forming smaller pockets of communities through which they would increasingly obtain information.\n\nInstitutions began adapting to this new Internet age, or they became obsolete. Looking forward, many companies that led the charge in Web 2's business model were master adopters of Web 1 or new entrants, and only time can tell what will happen in Web 3.\n\nGiven the advent of blockchains, non-custodial wallets, and NFTs – each of which enables users to own the networks they're a part of – it's safe to say that Web 3 has begun.\n\n# Web 1 Technical Evolution\n\n## Web 1 History\n\nThe Internet's genesis dates back to the early 1980s, but computer science has been a respected discipline since the 1950s. Major computing centers were being built worldwide but lacked adequate standardization, preventing network interoperability.\n\nThe Internet was born once the TCP/IP protocol was globally implemented and Tim Berners-Lee successfully communicated between a client and a server in 1989. Internet service providers (ISPs) soon began providing Internet to the public, and the first web page went live on August 6th, 1991.\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-1-2.webp)\n\nThe first website, and many more built during the 1990s, had severe limitations compared to today's websites. They typically contained text and hyperlinks, which brought you to another website with the same format and were read-only. As these websites evolved, the content distribution function of the Internet became more streamlined. By the year 2000, over 17 million websites and over 360 million people were browsing them.\n\nMany of these websites were variations of the image above and rarely involved user interaction. The Internet represented a collection of documents, although a few key innovations occurred in programming languages that helped lay the groundwork for Web 2.\n\n## Innovations\n\nNew programming languages can enable entirely new functionality within a computing system. When the web was first introduced, there were high barriers to entry, but as more programming languages were implemented, more specialized roles became available, such as UX/UI designers, back-end developers, and application engineers. This specialization dramatically lowered barriers to entry while radically enhancing the Internet itself.\n\n### HTML\n\nHyperText Markup Language (HTML) became publicly available in 1991 and enabled web browsers to combine text, images, and audio files to create a website. While HTML is functional in distributing content, it is severely limited in how the content is distributed.\n\n### CSS\n\nBefore the programming language CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was introduced in 1994, content and presentation were one and the same. With CSS, designers and developers could separate the two and concentrate on implementing the website's visual experience.\n\n### JS\n\nAlthough CSS was introduced in 1994, it didn't become mainstream until the early 2000s. Then, Javascript (JS) became more popular as Microsoft opted for it over the underdeveloped ECMAScript language. Microsoft was a monopoly during this time, monopolizing over 90% of the browser market through its Internet Explorer product, so this adoption of JS became widespread quite quickly.\n\nOver the years, many new languages have been implemented across the Internet, but HTML, CSS, and JS remain dominant.\n\n# Impact and Legacy\n\n## Setting the Stage\n\nAlthough Web 1 was built during an Unraveling phase, which implies weak institutions and a strong sense of individualism, it ironically set the stage for institutions to wield more power than ever before. Most of the heavy lifting was done by huge organizations like CERN, IBM, and Microsoft; these were the control entities.\n\nThe physical and digital infrastructure and the standards and protocols enacted by these intermediaries left significant gaps for future companies like Google and Facebook to fill in monopolistic fashions.\n\n## Deflationary Technology\n\nTechnology is deflationary in many respects because it makes things easier and cheaper.\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-1-4.webp)\n\nIt lowers the cost of production and creates economies of scale. Web 1 had high barriers to entry, which became shorter as the technology involved became more user-friendly. Individuals slowly gained more power as time passed, leading to rapid development and user interactivity through e-commerce websites, messaging services, and social media networks.\n\nThis newfound power of the individual in unison with destabilized institutions mirrors the features of the Unraveling periods.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAlthough the level of desired decentralization and democracy during Web 1 was not achievable then, it was necessary. Not only did it inspire a generation of technological innovation, but it set in motion cultural movements and design philosophies that are being actualized in blockchains and decentralized infrastructure today.\n\nInstitutions lost influence during Web 1 / The Unraveling as more people spent time forming their communities on the Internet. The exceptions to this were the tech companies that disrupted the incumbents while eventually becoming the new, more powerful institutions in the Crisis period. We'll cover that in Web 2.\n\nWeb 1 functioned as needed, enabling the mass adoption of the Internet and its idealism. The tenets of decentralized access to information and global interconnectivity are significant themes that have permeated through Web 2 and are experiencing a rebirth in Web 3.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"53:[\"crypto\",\"tech\"]\n54:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"Web 1\"}\n55:T44d6,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\nIn Web 1, we broke down the cultural and generational context of how the infrastructure for the modern Internet came to be and how it set in motion the innovations that led to Web 2 and 3.\n\nThis article will examine how these periods have been influenced by the generations involved, the issues of the incumbents, and the desires of the new entrants.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nSince the onset of Web 2, internet usage has been primarily oriented around user-generated content (social media and e-commerce). This has enabled monopolistic, rent-seeking intermediaries to take a stranglehold on physical and digital content distribution channels. Many companies have acquired undue influence over what billions of people see and buy.\n\n### Web Eras Defined\n\nFor clarity's sake, below is a one-line description of each period.\n\nWeb 1 = Content delivery networks. (1990-2004)\n\nWeb 2 = Content creation networks. (2004-Present)\n\nWeb 3 = User-owned networks. (2017-Present)\n\n# Generational Context\n\n## Strauss-Howe Analysis\n\nFor a deeper understanding of the cultural shifts underlying the advancements and applications of the Internet, this series will distill a cross-generational perspective through the lens of the Strauss-Howe Generational Theory. To reiterate, this series does not argue for the validity of the theory, but rather, it's used to provide an anthropological angle from which we can view technological advancements. The theory details a recurring cycle of generations that introduce archetypes who possess behavioral traits associated with the period in which they grew up.\n\nThe world theoretically entered a crisis phase with the onset of 9/11, although some argue it didn't take full effect until around 2008 when the Great Recession began. This period brought about an international war on terror, unprecedented military spending, global financial hardship, the rise of big tech, and political polarization unlike ever before due to social media and people obtaining their information online from a disparate web of subjective sources rather than for example just the New York Times.\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-2-0.webp)\n\n## Archetypes\n\nEach generation grows up in a different phase—either a High, an Awakening, an Unraveling, or a Crisis—and the context of these phases informs the types of individuals who emerge from them.\n\nBelow is a chart explaining the different features and desires of the four archetypes in this theory. Each archetype is entirely informed by the periods in which a generation was born, came of age, transition in midlife, and how they act and are perceived as elders.\n\nUPDATE PHOTO\n\n## Artists \u0026 Heroes\n\nThe generation of people born during a Crisis is referred to as Artists and are generally sensitive and overprotected as children yet very adaptive. Growing up during the Crisis phase presents many challenges, and, according to the theory, Artists are known to overcomplicate issues while coming to terms with their worldview. They do, however, grow up to be thoughtful, process-oriented adults.\n\nThis is a helpful frame of reference for viewing the Artist generation's starkly contrasting ideology to the previous Hero generation. Heroes were born during the phase preceding the Crisis, known as the Unraveling, and generally work under the doctrine of \"moving fast and breaking things\" because they grew up to be optimistic and overconfident leaders (e.g., Mark Zuckerberg).\n\nArtists have a big chip on their shoulders. They need to rearrange the world's complexity into a more consensus-oriented edifice with flexible yet relatively indecisive methods. Examples of Artists in history include some of America's founding fathers and former US president, Theodore Roosevelt. These individuals were \"sensitive and complex social technicians, advocates of fair play and the politics of inclusion.\" (Source)\n\n# The Rise of Crypto\n\nYou may see where we're going with this. Of course, every new generation grows up with more advanced technology than the last. Still, this most recent generation of artists grew up during the exponential internet adoption curve. Having a smartphone and social networks highlighting the inequality and calamities throughout every corner of the world has seriously impacted the Artist's psyche and led to many unforeseen ramifications.\n\nGiven that the Web was initially conceived as a decentralized resource but was stifled during this Web 2 phase, it's unsurprising to see the tenets of decentralization coming back in full force within Web 3. Heroes, still in charge during the Crisis phase, are less keen on decentralization because it would dethrone them from their puppet-master-like societal positions. Artists are keen on it because of their emphasis on equality. Their actions are increasingly moving towards a more decentralized world, and the crypto industry is not only an aspect of that, but it's the essence of it.\n\nTo better understand this transition from Web 1 to Web 3, let's break down Web 2's history and issues as it is a problematic and necessary bridge between generations and technologies.\n\n# Web 2 Evolution\n\n## History\n\nWeb 1's innovations laid the groundwork for Web 2 in the sense that the necessary software and hardware-related infrastructures had been set in place. Bustling economies were sprouting from all angles of the Internet, and many were excited about all the potential of this new interconnected world being built. Investors began throwing money at whatever internet companies they could until what became known as the Tech Bubble popped.\n\n## The Tech Bubble\n\nFinancial bubbles get a bad reputation because of the feral fervor and FOMO within them. Still, they are not often respected as the necessary component of technological adoption they are. Bubbles can show the masses the potential of something, but you need to know what parts will last.\n\nMany considered e-commerce a bubble until Amazon took over the commerce world. Similarly, many believed the crypto industry was a market bubble in 2017 as some far-fetched ideas were being speculated upon. While many of these ideas (like decentralized ride-sharing services) did not pan out, others, like NFTs and synthetic assets, have experienced the beginning innings of mass adoption. They will likely disrupt many industries in the coming years.\n\nTechnology doesn't work how humans think. Humans think linearly, and technology operates exponentially. This exponentiality eradicates the tried and true investment trope of mean reversion because exponential averages always increase at exponential rates. To understand this from a high level, consider how semiconductors conform to Moore's Law and technological networks conform to Metcalfe's Law.\n\n### Moore's Law\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-2-1.webp)\n\nAccording to Moore's Law, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (microchip) doubles every two years. As you can see in the graph below, Moore's Law has been proven to be true since Intel's microchips debuted in the early 1970s. These transistors improve computing power and enable technological advances that drive unforeseen societal changes across all industries.\n\n### Metcalfe's Law\n\nMetcalfe's Law defines the value of a telecommunications network as the squared product of the number of users in the network. In other words, Metcalfe's Law mathematically describes the power of network effects. As each new user is introduced to a network, they bring the capacity to introduce other new users and interact with the previous users. This creates an economy of interactions that exponentially expands as more people join the network while the cost of the network only increases linearly.\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-2-2.webp)\n\n# Key Innovations\n\n## Social Media\n\nOne of Web 1's most significant limitations was its static nature. Users could barely interact with sites, and aside from messaging, they could barely interact with each other. In 1999, Web 1 was compared to the embryo of the Web to come, and Web 2 began circulating. The term has been defined in various ways, although the common understanding of it being related to user-generated content was widely understood when social media networks took over.\n\nSocial media is arguably the most influential innovation that has come out of Web 2. It involves psychology, human behavior, mob mentality, marketing, real news, fake news, artificial intelligence, politics, music, media, and every facet of human nature. Near the end of Web 1, MySpace and Facebook entered the scene, and nothing was the same. These were the first social media networks that grabbed the world's attention, and it was now easier than ever to stay connected with friends, family, and strangers than ever before.\n\nPosting and interacting with the world opened doors to new creator economies and affected the direction humanity was heading. Humans have never had the power to learn anything and connect with anyone at any time. This facilitated unprecedented content creation, curation, interaction, and even whistleblowing, as there were now countless avenues through which people could distill and obtain their information.\n\n### Information Distillation\n\nIf you look at old photographs of people on public transportation, you'll often see everybody reading the same newspaper. This phenomenon instilled a homogeneity of ideas.\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-2-4.webp)\n\nIt's similar to how most people are now on their phones and have headphones on when riding public transportation, except now everyone is reading and listening to their algorithmically curated news feeds. These news feeds disrupted big media because anyone could make a media channel and distill information to their following, irrespective of their background or credentials.\n\nThis affects how news is distributed and ingested in many other areas of society. Rather than every comedian trying to land a spot on Saturday Night Live or a role in a big NBC network show that aired at 7 p.m. on Monday nights, for example, they can start a YouTube channel or a podcast, air their special on Netflix, or even star in their show offered by a streaming service and go viral.\n\nThis societal change in information distillation was one of the first steps to decentralization, but we still have a long way to go.\n\n## Ecommerce\n\nA few decades ago, Web 2's e-commerce innovations disrupted traditional commerce in unimaginable ways. Platforms like eBay, Etsy, Shopify, Amazon, Reverb, and thousands of other e-commerce websites enabled anyone to build a virtual store selling real-world goods and interact with other people's stores. Until Web 2, massive manufacturing firms and distribution outlets controlled what was sold and how people could buy things.\n\nWhile these firms still maintained market dominance through their e-commerce stores, the playing field was much higher than previously—countless stories of individuals building a niche online store and generating massive revenue. E-commerce has quickly become a standard operating procedure for celebrities with a devoted following.\n\nE-commerce doesn't only apply to real-world goods. It applies to any transaction made virtually. Disparate industries like gaming and sex work have been flipped upside down as platforms like Twitch and OnlyFans have generated hundreds of millions of dollars in paid subscriptions for their content creators. These platforms are entirely built on user-generated content and have their own novel sets of pros and cons dealt with in Web 3.\n\n# Challenges and Issues\n\n## Web 2's Business Model\n\nThe progress of Web 2 has brought about industry-changing platforms like Facebook, Amazon, and Google, which are very useful. Still, the users themselves are included as products in these business models.\n\nThe more you peruse Facebook, the more Facebook knows about you and how to market to you. The same things go for any centralized platform. Amazon will let you sell products on their site, learn from you if you're successful, and then implement what you did while placing your products behind their own in the search results.\n\nThese issues are readily apparent, and the Artist archetypes spearheading Web 3's developments are highly aware of them.\n\n## Privacy Concerns\n\nWhen Web 2 platforms began being adopted by the masses, all seemed good. You could do all sorts of amazing things that were impossible only a few years prior. As these platforms matured, their unintended side effects became more evident. To the unsuspecting eye, these free platforms and all the free things you could do on them seemed like the product being offered.\n\nThe reality is that the users of these platforms are the product, and it is very expensive to have your data measured and manipulated by centralized intermediaries.\n\n### Hacks \u0026 Data Leaks\n\nHacks and data leaks are common problems. A month ago, 7 million accounts on Robinhood had their data hacked and obtained by an anonymous third party. Other than changing its privacy policy and issuing an apology, there is nothing that Robinhood can do to right this wrong. They are not liable because they state the risk of these things happening in their terms and service. It's the user's fault for trusting Robinhood (especially after the Gamestop debacle).\n\n### Data Selling\n\nHave you ever Googled something you wanted to buy and suddenly had your Facebook feed filled with ads related to what you Googled? Facebook is known as one of the greediest data collectors, as these social media, browser, and commerce apps track each other's activities. They also partake in knowing what your friends are up to. If your Facebook friends have been searching for a couch to buy lately, the algorithms think you may be interested in purchasing a sofa, too, and all of a sudden, there will be couches and loveseats for sale all over your feed.\n\nThese centralized intermediaries will sell your data to other centralized intermediaries, and everyone is making money from you wasting away while staring at your device. The more you use these apps, the more money they earn and the more efficient they get at making it.\n\n## Censorship\n\nBlockchains and many of the innovations of Web 3 are much more censorship-resistant, but Web 2 is quite the opposite. Given the influence of these centralized intermediating monopolies, they can prevent you from using their services for any reason.\n\nThis is a huge issue when it comes to free speech and whistleblowing. Whistleblowers need free speech as their purpose is to publicly present data that has been locked behind closed doors by these centralized intermediaries and governing bodies.\n\n## Fake News\n\nWeb 2 enabled individuals to create content networks, drastically changing how society ingests said content. The ramifications of this paradigm shift are both positive and negative. It's now easier than ever to fabricate news or share toxic worldviews with no consequence. Nefarious actors can infiltrate an emerging market and manipulate societal belief systems and political elections while spreading distrust in centralized governance systems. This is a result of the decentralization of mass media, which has some significant benefits along with these listed downsides.\n\nWhen everyone used to read the New York Times every day, they ingested the same content. Now, hundreds of networks exploit the 24/7 news cycle to compete for users' attention spans by creating clickbait, which is false, misleading, or unverified news meant to initiate engagement.\n\nIt has been well-documented that negative and bombastic headlines spur digital engagement more than positive and objective ones within social media algorithms. This divides social sentiment and creates unhealthy dynamics between people who otherwise would have had nothing to do with one another. You can trace these engagement metrics back to the mid-1990s when Fox News and other media outlets began substituting objective anchors with subjective talking heads.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAn archetype will not give birth to a similar archetype but rather a contrasting one.\n\nThe Hero generation disrupted the Nomad generation and began deconstructing and rebuilding the institutions built before them. Artists grew up in the Hero's world and felt similar needs to deconstruct and rebuild but with a more sensitive and equality-based perspective.\n\nWith all of Web 2's downsides, and there are plenty, it truly is a marvel how interconnected the world has become over the last few decades. It has created trillions of dollars in market capitalization, helped bring millions out of poverty, and has minted more millionaires and billionaires than any other period in history while enabling humans to have powers that could only be dreamed of a few decades ago - even more so with Web 3 once Bitcoin and wallets made self-custody widespread. The Artist generation recognizes this progress along with the problematic caveats it entails.\n\nAs the financial world crumbled during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008, an anonymous developer, Satoshi Nakamoto, combined the innovations that led the crypto revolution to where it is today into the Bitcoin blockchain, and the rest is history.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"56:[\"crypto\",\"tech\"]\n57:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"Web 2\"}\n58:T519d,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nWeb 3 is a technical philosophy that has disrupted previous internet models by empowering users to take more ownership of the products they're using.\n\nSome say it's a fugazi, and others may define it differently than how you understand it, but there's no denying that users' relationship with the Internet is changing.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## The Evolution of the Web\n\n### Web 1: The Unraveling and Web 2: The Crisis\n\nWeb 1: The Unraveling and Web 2: The Crisis broke down the series of events, innovations, and issues that brought the Internet to its current state. We live in a predominantly digital era, and most websites today still follow the Web 2 business model, where the users are the ultimate product.\n\nWeb 2 is the necessary bridge between Web 1 and Web 3, but it presents a pandora's box of issues regarding privacy concerns, censorship, and content distribution. This stems from the centralized intermediaries that have become monopolies over the past few decades. They govern news feeds, browser searches, and how people connect and spend their time online.\n\nThis article will explain how users of Web 3 can own the networks they're a part of, how open source ideology is transforming the fabric of the Internet, and how Web 3 generates unforeseen value.\n\nFor clarity, below is a one-line description of each period.\n\nWeb 1 = Content delivery networks. (1990-2004)\n\nWeb 2 = Content creation networks. (2004-Present)\n\nWeb 3 = User-owned networks. (2017-Present)\n\n## The Promise of Web 3\n\nThroughout this deep dive series, different eras of the Internet have been viewed through the Strauss-Howe Generational Theory, which details a recurring cycle of archetypal generations.\n\nThese archetypes possess behavioral traits associated with the period in which they grew up as the surrounding context and coming of age of these generations directly influence how they view the world and behave as adults.\n\n### Artists \u0026 Heroes\n\nAccording to the theory, the generation known as Artists grew up during the Crisis period (2001-present), and we left off with them butting heads with the Hero generation who grew up during the Unraveling Period (1982-2000). Heroes like Mark Zuckerberg (Born 1982) and Evan Spiegel (Born 1990) are in monopolistic positions of power and are often unreflective and overbold.\n\nArtists, on the other hand, are known to grow up into thoughtful adults as they tend to emphasize equality and practicality in contrast to the chaotic indecisiveness they inherited from the context of their upbringing. The divide between these two groups is very much a result of the impending power transfers that Web 3 is enabling.\n\nHeroes are not in a position where they want to decentralize their control. Web 2 has worked out very well for those in power as magnificent wealth has been generated at the cost of users' privacy and autonomy. The Artist archetypes, acting as the underdogs, are participating in Web 3 and see massive opportunities for disruption. However, most of the generation is still confined to the restraints of Web 2 due to their digital lives being maintained by Web 2 platforms.\n\n## Economic Context\n\n### Assets \u0026 Valuations\n\nArtists are growing up during a period in which asset valuations worldwide are at unprecedented levels. This is usually the case as global GDP grows, but the rate of change in asset price rise has never been this parabolic. From a traditional economic standpoint, the fact that interest rates have been declining for multiple decades is also a sign of a fragile global economy.\n\nWith stocks and risky assets at all-time highs and bonds and risk-free assets yielding all-time lows, where should all the money go?\n\n## The Role of Cryptocurrency\n\n### Crypto\n\nOne method of working around the present system is decentralizing control and building new assets. The crypto industry has introduced more innovation and financial products than most people can keep up with, and these assets serve entirely new use cases. They don't fit the molds that traditional finance has created.\n\nBalaji Srinivasan has a great quote that sums up the enhancements being implemented:\n\n\"Tokens are not securities in the same way that YouTube is not Television.\"\n\nSome tokens may have qualities that mimic securities, but they also have new attributes that regulatory frameworks have not defined. These qualities effectively enable users to own the networks they are a part of.\n\nAs Balaji puts it, YouTube is not television.\n\n### User-Owned Networks\n\nWhen the web was first envisioned, developers had a utopian perspective of free information, borderless interconnectivity, and individual solidarity. This was all good in theory, but in practice, the web was controlled by a handful of companies who now have far too much influence on humanity's trajectory. Web 3's focus on decentralization and interoperability looks to dismantle this paradigm and usher in a more equitable and capable internet.\n\nYou may think that user-owned networks have existed for a long time, given that you can invest in a company's stock, but it's not the same. Investing in companies requires far more barriers to entry than participating in a network does. This concept is best described with a simple thought experiment: Imagine being paid in Facebook shares based on your value to the platform. Although it can be difficult to quantify value, this new user engagement model incentivizes value creation and ultimately beckons a better Facebook for all network users. This benefits the users and Facebook. Win-win. So why wouldn't Facebook do this?\n\nFirst, Facebook went live in 2004, over a decade before Ethereum's private sale. Ethereum was the first programmable blockchain because it enabled smart contracts, and its innovations were necessary for user-owned networks to be possible. Smart contracts allowed the ERC20 and ERC721 standards to exist, which have since changed the entire crypto landscape from innovations in financial plumbing to creator tools.\n\n### ERC20 \u0026 ERC721 Standards\n\nERC20 tokens enabled anyone to deploy a fungible token to the Ethereum blockchain, and ERC721 tokens enabled anyone to deploy a *non-*fungible token (NFT) to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThese standards have inspired others and have been implemented across chains, including Solana, Ethereum, and Avalanche. In each of these cases, users can now own the network they are a part of – at least a part of it in some sense. No standards even remotely similar to these existed when Facebook hit the market, as there were no blockchains on which these standards could operate.\n\n### Cryptocurrency as Equity\n\nIf you ask most financial advisors right now how to position your portfolio about cryptocurrencies and equities, your answer would probably be 95% equities and 5% crypto or even 0% crypto. This draws a clear line in the sand between cryptocurrencies and equities when they are more alike than different.\n\nSure, some cryptocurrencies serve zero use cases and are nothing more than speculative instruments, but others are entire networks. If you were to invest in ETH, SOL, or AVAX, you would own a piece of these networks, and this tradable ownership could be considered equity. Tokens, such as the ones conforming to the ERC20 standard, are built and deployed atop these networks.\n\nEach of these tokens has its use case, tokenomics, and distribution schedule that should be diligently researched before being speculated upon. NFA.\n\n## Innovations in Fundraising\n\n### Fund Raising\n\nAnother vital component of Web 3 thus far has been the innovations in the fundraising industry. Traditionally, startup companies have either gone through a series of venture capital funding rounds or have been bootstrapped. This was until Mastercoin implemented the world's first Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2013, an innovation that spurred the imagination of many investors later on during the 2017 ICO bubble.\n\nThis bubble, which was relatively similar to the Tech Bubble but at a much smaller scale, displayed the excitement people had about how projects and companies could now raise money. Some were raising a lot of money, which attracted a few nefarious actors and influencers like John McAfee and Floyd Mayweather, who promoted low-quality projects that essentially went to zero. The ICO industry has since evolved into multiple variations of ICOs that each serve different purposes. These will impact Web 3's fundraising and development going forward.\n\nFor the record, there are still \\*\\*far too many nefarious influencers promoting garbage. Kim Kardashian promoted Ethereum Max. Influencers like BitBoy are constantly up to no good. When money is involved, anything can happen, so be wary of who you follow.\n\n### ICO / IDO / ITO / IAO / Etc.\n\nICOs are a spin-off of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), the traditional method of large-scale fundraising for companies looking to enter the public markets. So, it's not surprising that there are so many ICO spin-offs. These include but are not limited to the following:\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-3-0.webp)\n\n### NFTs\n\nNFTs have endless utilities. Just think of them as a medium to facilitate digital ownership. Their fundraising potential has only begun to be tapped and will likely affect how many projects finance their operations. They're not just PFPs - but PFPs have been blasting off recently.\n\n#### Aurory\n\nAurory recently issued 10,000 Aurorians, becoming one of Solana's most traded NFT projects. This resulted in 1,000 SOL (~$180,000) in minting sales and passive, perpetual income due to secondary sales.\n\nThen, the developing team raised over $108 million with an IDO.\n\nAnyone who minted and held an Aurorian has experienced significant price appreciation, personal relationships with others who own (and perhaps identify) with Aurorians, and a financial stake in the project's development.\n\n#### The Infinite Garden\n\n![infinite Image](/images/web-3-2.webp)\n\nThere is also a documentary titled Ethereum: The Infinite Garden that raised nearly 1,036 ETH, now valued at over $4 million, through the sales of NFTs associated with the movie.\n\n#### 3LAU\n\nElectronic music producer 3LAU decided to list his previously released album from several years ago for sale as an NFT, and he netted over $11 million. This has enabled him to finance projects such as Royal.io, which is intended to disrupt the music royalty industry with NFTs.\n\n## Blockchain \u0026 Project Grants\n\nIf you follow crypto-related content on LinkedIn and casually scroll through your newsfeed, you'll be hard-pressed not to find articles related to new blockchain investment funds. Blockchains and DeFi projects are constantly doling out grants meant to help improve their surrounding ecosystem.\n\nGrants are great. They've historically been able to fund essential projects within academia and elsewhere, but they've recently taken their funding game to the next level due to crypto-related innovations like DAOs.\n\n### Gitcoin\n\n![Fundraising Image](/images/web-3-3.webp)\n\nGitcoin was designed to enable the funding of public goods. These goods are often open-source software, so many grants go to coders, developers, and founders. Gitcoin grants are decided upon by the Gitcoin DAO, which is composed of GTC holders. Gitcoin's definition of public goods is based on non-rivalrous and non-profitable endeavors, usually related to public digital infrastructure.\n\nGitcoin has instituted quadratic funding, which, in summary, gives projects with the most backers priority in terms of financing compared to projects with ample funding but fewer backers. For more details, read Vitalik's post on his website and all his other posts for good measure.\n\n### Treasury Grants \u0026 DAOs\n\nDAOs are still unproven, yet their utility and benefits seem hopeful. Their legal status and funding mechanisms are still grey areas, although some have successfully implemented payments to participants and projects in their communities. We'll see how it goes.\n\nMy favorite example of this is NounsDAO.\n\nNounsDAO is an ambitious NFT project that will mint one noun every day forever. After 103 days, these Nouns' sale prices are averaging well above 100 ETH, and each signifies entrance into NounsDAO. Smart contracts govern the entire project, and 100% of every sale is deposited into the community's treasury, which at the time of writing holds over 14,456 ETH, or $69,388,800. That's an average revenue stream and profit of $673,677.67 per day. Good luck finding any startup with those numbers.\n\nThis treasury is used to help build products and projects surrounding the Noun community, such as Nouns.com, a hot or not game between pairs of different Nouns, and even a hangout area built within the CryptoVoxels metaverse. They also decided to donate 30 ETH to charity; you can see their record. Below is an image of transactions from their public treasury wallet.\n\n![Open Source Image](/images/web-3-4.webp)\n\nImagine a crypto-friendly city like Miami, Lisbon, or New York deciding to level its transparency and operate all financial transactions on a public blockchain. It probably won't happen, but it could with a Web 3 framework. NounsDAO is silly but most innovations on the Internet start silly.\n\n## Open Source and Interoperability\n\n### Open Source\n\nBlockchains are the fundamental settlement layers of all the Web 3 applications being built, and public blockchains are open source. These on-chain applications are also open source, which helps explain the ridiculous level of development that occurs within the crypto industry every year. Developers usually have access to the entire backend of an app, and functions can be forked, copied, and expanded upon.\n\n### Money Legos\n\nInteroperability is the property of Web 3 that allows these DeFi applications to interact with one another. You can now cultivate and manage your wealth trustlessly and permissionlessly.\n\nUtilizing DeFi, investors have many options, from generating a yield on a borrowed asset while maintaining exposure to the collateral to supplying liquidity to an AMM that rewards them with trading fees. Yieldless and yield-bearing tokens are all interoperable. Below is a simple example of how to do so.\n\nStake SOL using Marinade and receive mSOL.\nDeposit SOL/mSOL into a liquidity pool and earn trading fees.\nVoila, you are earning a yield (Transaction fees from the SOL/mSOL pool) on both a yieldless asset (SOL) and a yield-bearing asset (mSOL).\n\n### Decentralized Dashboards\n\nMoney managers and banks custody assets and need ways of keeping tabs on them. While financial dashboards may not seem important to most people, they're products that can lower one's need for any bank or money manager. They're tools for you to go bankless.\n\nDeFi enables you to do everything you can in traditional finance and more in a permissionless and trustless fashion. In Web 2 and conventional finance, you can connect your banking and investment accounts to dashboards like Mint and Copilot, but you must divulge all your accounts' information. In Web 3, you can have multiple wallets operating across multiple chains doing complicated activities such as providing liquidity, borrowing, or utilizing synthetic assets and displaying them within one interface.\n\nWhen you connect to a multichain wallet dashboard like DeBank, your activity will be present, filterable, and graphically represented. Other worthy dashboards include ApeBoard, YieldWatch, and SonarWatch. These dashboards not only give you the ability to self custody your money, but they do so without having any access to your information aside from your public wallet address and your blockchain balances.\n\n### Forks\n\nGood artists borrow, and great artists steal. - Pablo Picasso\n\nSuch is the case for many DeFi protocols, as they are often forked versions of each other with attempted enhancements. Forking can enable unprecedented levels of innovation but also allow bad actors to make nefarious platforms very quickly, especially on blockchains with low fees like Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Forks ultimately provoke competition and help instill a constant need for projects to stay on their toes rather than become complacent.\n\nAn infamous example of a forked project is SushiSwap. During the DeFi Summer of 2020, Uniswap was the go-to DEX for most people, as its daily volume surpassed Coinbase. A competitor called SushiSwap came along and forked the project while adding an enhanced incentive reward system through its issue of SUSHI tokens.\n\nThis drained Uniswap of a substantial volume, and they responded by issuing an airdrop of UNI tokens to anyone who had participated on the platform earlier. UNI token holders govern the platform, and UNI's market capitalization has since risen to nearly $13 billion at the time of writing. SUSHIi's market cap is just over $2 billion.\n\n## Generating Value\n\n### Liquidity Pools\n\nTo learn more about Liquidity Pools in detail, read this. For the sake of this article, you need to understand that liquidity pools enable anyone to provide liquidity for somebody else to trade off pseudonymously. In traditional finance, these liquidity providers are market makers.\n\nThese pools generate trading fees transmitted to the liquidity providers and, in many cases, to a community-governed treasury. The liquidity providers are earning a yield that doesn't exist for retail participants in traditional finance. Its creation is a byproduct of using non-custodial wallets and AMMs built within liquidity pools.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Token Terminal's home page, which displays the profitability metrics such as Price/Sales and Price/Earnings ratios of each DeFi protocol and underlying blockchain.\n\n![Open Source Image](/images/web-3-5.webp)\n\n## Moatless\n\nIndustries have been defined by centralized intermediaries building and investors obsessing over economic moats, which are facets of a business that separate it from others.\n\nIn theory, moats exist in Web 3 but don't serve the same purpose as in Web 1 and 2. Sure, innovation is incentivized and rewarded, but the competition is unbridled due to the open-source nature of development. When more eyes are looking at something, more mistakes are noticed.\n\nYou'll continue to hear stories of white-cap hackers that expose vulnerabilities in open-source protocols in return for a reward or just for the good of the community. This inadvertently generates massive amounts of value by securing the network.\n\n### White Cap Hackers\n\nA hacker stole over $600 million from the Polygon Layer 2 scaling solution, and it was all returned. The Polygon team then attempted to recruit the hacker, but he declined by responding with messages written into smart contracts, such as the one below.\n\n![Open Source Image](/images/web-3-6.webp)\n\nAnother hacker exposed an 850 million dollar vulnerability and was awarded a 2 million bug bounty.\n\nThis value generation through white cap hacking and bug bounties was not an intended consequence of Web 3, but it is a happy accident. Unfortunately, black cap hacking is still an issue, as over 70 DeFi exploits have resulted in losses of over $1.5 billion.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nWhile most of the world still operates under the umbrella that Web 2 is holding out, every day, more people are switching their desired internet use to function in ways that only Web 3 enables. Heroes are either adapting to this new paradigm or fighting it off. The Artist generation recognizes this along with the inherent issues of Web 2 and the immense value propositions of Web 3.\n\nIt's a complex web of financial and security-related innovation and an even more complex web of communities fusing to form a global perspective. This perspective is naturally more decentralized and permissionless than the centralized vision of Web 2, and it aligns more with the original, idealistic vision of the World Wide Web that the early developers had at the beginning of Web 1.\n\nSome people doubt that this new paradigm exists or has any foundation, the same way they doubted that a website can safely store their credit card information.\n\nThe world has evolved and will continue to do so, but the implications will be staggering once Web 3's innovations are adopted into the mainstream. This adoption may take a while due to governmental bodies, UX considerations, regulatory restrictions, and financial incumbents wanting to remain in control. Still, fortunately for the world, Web 3 is not just around the corner. It's already here.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"59:[\"crypto\",\"tech\"]\n5a:{\"src\":\"/misc/placeholder.webp\",\"alt\":\"Web 3\"}\n5e:T2446,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cdiv className=\"tldrSection\"\u003e\n  Blockchains are distributed ledgers, meaning no single entity controls them. Ledgers are merely lists of transactions, but what these lists can do is only beginning to be understood.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n# Financial Intermediaries\n\nThe global financial system's network of intermediaries—including commercial banks, investment brokers, and asset management firms—processes trillions in daily transactions and serves as critical bottlenecks for capital movement worldwide. While home to many reputable institutions, the industry faces ongoing scrutiny over practices that often escape public view, with major banks facing accusations of regulatory violations.\n\nConflicts of interest exist at every level, as evidenced by the current SEC chairman, Gary Gensler, who amassed significant wealth during his lengthy career at Goldman Sachs before entering public office. Similarly, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell accumulated an estimated $50 million through his work at various investment banks before joining the Treasury Department in 1990. The market has been up only since then, so it's safe to say he's wealthy. In any case, they are the well-connected 0.01% governing the 99.99% in the world's most prosperous country, where 22% of the population didn't even have a bank account in 2019.\n\n## For Reference\n\n\u003cdiv className=\"tableWrapper\"\u003e\n\n| Institution     | Total Regulatory Fines | Violations |\n| --------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |\n| Bank of America | $82.7B                 | 214        |\n| JPMorgan Chase  | $35.7B                 | 158        |\n| Citigroup       | $25.4B                 | 122        |\n| Wells Fargo     | $21.3B                 | 181        |\n| Deutsche Bank   | $18.1B                 | 59         |\n| UBS             | $16.7B                 | 83         |\n| Goldman Sachs   | $16.3B                 | 44         |\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nNot all banks are bad, just as not all DeFi protocols are good. The table above illustrates the scale of regulatory violations in traditional banking, highlighting why alternative financial systems have gained attention. Let's explore how we got here.\n\n# The Evolution of Central Banking\n\nThe Federal Reserve (FED) was established in 1913 as the third attempt at a central banking system in the United States. After the bank runs of 1907-1910 caused by fractional reserve lending, Chase Bank's founder J.P. Morgan and other influential bankers developed a plan that became the Federal Reserve—a hybrid faction within the US government that sets banking standards but operates independently of direct voter control.\n\n## The Mandate\n\nThe Federal Reserve operates under what is known as the \"dual mandate,\" established by Congress in the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977.\n\nThe two primary objectives are:\n\n1. Maximum employment (not a specific unemployment rate)\n2. Price stability (which the Fed has interpreted as targeting 2% inflation over time)\n\nThe Fed seeks to achieve these goals through various monetary policy tools, primarily by adjusting interest rates and managing the money supply. The 2% inflation target wasn't officially adopted until 2012, when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) first explicitly stated this goal. Interest rates have been trending down for centuries and the consequences and byproducts of money printing are debated over.\n\n![Historical interest rates trend over 400 years showing a declining pattern](/images/400y-interest.webp)\n\n## Side Effects\n\nOne way to evaluate the Federal Reserve's economic impact is by examining two key relationships: the correlation between its balance sheet and the S\u0026P 500 index, and the long-term trajectory of the US dollar's purchasing power.\n\n![Federal Reserve balance sheet correlation with S\u0026P 500](/images/fed-sp.webp)\n\nWall street optimists argue that because of the US's dominance, it doesn't matter how much money is printed and centralized intermediaries are a battle-tested system that is worth more than the trouble of occasionally bailing out a few bad actors.\n\nSo, where does DeFi come in? It varies. If you're in one of the wealthier countries in the world, you may utilize DeFi as an alternative or speculative investment class but for those in less financially secure countries, you may be using DeFi because you don't have any other option.\n\n# DeFi\n\nFor those in non-financially secure countries, what's the alternative? A continuation of opaque market procedures, unsustainable monetary policy, and hyper-inflationary events of debased fiat currencies becoming the norm?\n\n## DeFi's Use Cases Today\n\n### Stable Coins\n\nLet's say you live in Turkey. The Turkish Lira experienced a reported 78% inflation from 2021-2022. So, if the bank gives you back your deposit, your $100 worth of TRL will be roughly $22. This type of heartache used to be unavoidable for the global middle and lower classes, but now there's an alternative.\n\nInstead of using a soon-to-be-defunct domestic bank in a country with a falling currency, you can open a non-custodial wallet like Solflare and securely store infinite digital assets. This wallet isn't physical. You can bring it across borders by remembering your recovery phrase or keeping a copy of your private key.\n\nOperational security risks and other nuances need to be considered, but this example gives you an idea of what's possible. How easy is it to withdraw $25,000 from your bank? How easy is it to travel across violent borders with that $25,000—especially if that $25,000 worth of value is in a currency other than the USD? The answers are all that it is exceedingly difficult to do so without DeFi.\n\n### Censorship Resistance\n\nReal estate debt levels and nationalized industry have taken a toll on the Chinese banking system, and some banks have already censored withdrawals. Chinese authorities recently switched some citizen health codes from Covid negative to positive (which effectively banned them from all public venues and transport systems) to prevent them from withdrawing from their bank. In May of 2022, it was reported that nearly 1 million Chinese customers were unable to withdraw money from bank accounts.\n\nThen tanks were deployed on the protesters who had their funds frozen.\n\n![Chinese tanks deployed during bank protests](/images/tank-webp.png)\n\nRegarding centralization and censorship, China is extreme, but the world operates on a spectrum. The need for DeFi also operates on that spectrum.\n\n### Yield Generation\n\nCrypto builders have developed various approaches to generating yields, with varying degrees of legitimacy and sustainability. Some mechanisms represent genuine financial innovation but others - particularly centralized platforms like the now-defunct Celsius - proved to be poorly regulated and over-leveraged systems that misrepresented risks. Liquidity pools stand out as an example of legitimate yield generation that democratizes access to trading profits.\n\nAutomated Market Makers (AMMs) are smart contracts deployed on blockchains that enable asset trading through algorithmically managed liquidity pools. These systems compensate liquidity providers in two primary ways: through a share of trading fees or through incentive token distributions. The revenue model for most decentralized exchanges (DEXes) centers on distributing trading fees to liquidity providers - a stark contrast to traditional finance where such yields were typically restricted to institutional market makers.\n\nBelow is a list of the top 5 7-Day Average Fees metrics DEXes across various blockchains.\n\n![Uniswap and other DEX statistics](/images/uniswap.webp)\n\nThis democratization of market-making represents a significant shift from traditional financial structures. The blockchain infrastructure underlying these systems also brings unprecedented transparency, as trading activities and settlements are recorded on public ledgers, simplifying what was historically an opaque process.\n\nRyan Selkis, the CEO of Messari, recently published a [thread](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1551874256761659393?s=20\u0026t=cDNrQAr0FsQJXotpRolEAA) of 35 use cases for which you can use DeFi. It's worth a scroll.\n\n# A Balanced Approach\n\nThe emergence of Defi represents more than just a technological evolution in financial services—it marks a fundamental shift in how we think about and interact with money. The traditional financial systems have served as the backbone of global commerce for centuries but their limitations and vulnerabilities have become increasingly apparent in the digitally age. Defi's promise lies not in replacing these systems outright, but in providing alternatives that address their core limitations: accessibility, transparency, and resistance to censorship.\n\nAs we move forward, the challenge will be striking the right balance between innovation and stability, and between decentralization and practical utility. The future of finance likely lies in a thoughtful integration of both traditional and decentralized finance, where each serves the purposes for which it is best suited. For those seeking alternatives to traditional banking—whether due to economic instability, political censorship, or a desire for greater financial autonomy—DeFi offers not just hope, but increasingly practical solutions.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"5f:{\"title\":\"A Bird's Eye View\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"Seeing the Forest Through the Trees\",\"tags\":\"$e\",\"image\":\"$f\"}\n5d:{\"id\":\"birdseye-view\",\"slug\":\"birdseye-view\",\"title\":\"A Bird's Eye View\",\"content\":\"$5e\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/birdseye-view\",\"frontmatter\":\"$5f\",\"description\":\"Seeing the Forest Through the Trees\",\"tags\":\"$e\",\"image\":\"$f\"}\n61:T1ff6,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nBlockchains are ever-expanding ledgers of transactions that have distinct features and functionalities which differentiate them from traditional computing networks. As a result, they open doors to new ways of doing things and this article explores the foundational knowledge required to understand them from the ground up.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nThe impl of a blockchain is for transactions to be Transactions are grouped into blocks and verified by a distributed network of computers that earn money for participating in the verification process. Distributed means that these computers are not governed by any central entity but rather by a widespread collection of individual entities. This network collectively creates a public ledger that can be indexed and searched with extreme detail. Anything that happens on a public blockchain is immediately and immutably a part of the public record.\n\n## Accounts \u0026 Wallets\n\nEach account is accessed with a digital wallet. Accounts hold an individual or entity's tokens, which can be freely transferred between wallets and interact with applications that are compatible with the wallet. These applications can be financial or used for gaming, messaging, and virtually anything else.\n\nUnlike traditional markets, blockchains operate all day, so on-chain markets run 24/7, and anyone with a wallet can participate.\n\n## Reducing Counterparty Risk\n\nConsensus methods are the backbone of any blockchain. In the next chapter, we'll explain their work in more detail. They are meant to give disparate network participants the ability to verify the truth without trusting anyone or relying on any centralized entity to act accurately or ethically.\n\nNot wanting to trust a counterparty may sound counterintuitive, but if there is no counterparty, then there is no counterparty risk. If there are no ethics, there is no misbehavior. It's a technical philosophy embodied in the code behind decentralized systems, and it's all possible because of consensus methods.\n\nConsensus methods are algorithms that an incentivized computer network uses to participate in collective transaction verification. The process of how this works varies from method to method.\n\n## Digital Transparency\n\nSpecific blockchains (ZEC, MXR, SCRT) are oriented towards privacy, but most are transparent by default. A blockchain scanner can openly search and index every detail of every transaction, as shown below.\n\nYou can see that 0.00203928 SOL was transferred from one wallet to another on March 18, 03:21:07 AM +UTC, and the transaction fee was 0.000005 SOL (a fraction of $0.01).\n\nOn other blockchains, transaction fees can quickly go into the dozens and hundreds of dollars, depending on network congestion. Using Solana, you can make 1,000,000 trades and only pay ~$10 in transaction fees.\n\n## The Store of Value Narrative\n\nBitcoin was initially intended to be a peer-to-peer medium of exchange, although its narrative has switched mainly to that of a global store of value. Countries that use their proprietary currency other than the big six (USD—United States Dollar, CAD—Canadian Dollar, EUR—Euro, AUS—Australian Dollar, JPY—Japanese Yen, and GBP—British Pound) are subject to grave risks imposed by the arbiters of the big six.\n\nRather than hold onto, for example ��� the Turkish Lira or South African Rand and have their spending power decline over time, many have fled to BTC or other cryptocurrencies that enable pseudonymous, secure transfers of value and opportunities for capital appreciation. Bitcoin, for example, increased in value by 6,965,454,545.45% between 2010 and 2021.\n\nIts low was $0.00099, and the all-time high was $$68,958.\n\n## Uncertainty\n\nFinancial markets serve many critical economic functions, although they do not always reflect what's happening in the real world. They often aren't. The stock market, for example, is constantly attempting to base prices and valuations on future expectations. To predict future outcomes, you want the least amount of uncertainty involved.\n\nMarkets are always searching for certainty.\n\nWhen outcomes are uncertain – such as when a supply chain crisis, a war, or a pandemic occurs- prices will reflect that. Speculative assets like revenueless tech stocks or purposeless altcoins will reflect uncertainty by having their price spike downwards because there is no more perceived value. Re-pricings will occur, even if it's not immediate. It's easy to forget that asset prices can go down another 99% after dropping by 99%.\n\n## Mimetic Desire\n\nPhysical gold bars have historically outperformed most assets during periods of economic strife. As a result, gold has become a haven asset in the eyes of asset managers. It's important to understand that money flows from speculative investments to safe-haven assets doesn't happen automatically. It's a result of trader psychology being influenced by mimetic desire, and it happens slowly, then all at once.\n\nOther than its use in jewelry and select manufacturing, gold is perceived to exist outside of the traditional financial system, although banks are the largest owners of it. Derivatives are constantly used to manipulate its price, so that is a relatively naïve assumption. Below is one of the many headlines detailing big bank baboonery. In this instance, JPM Chase had to pay a $920 million fine.\n\nSource\nEven though gold has performed well in the past during times of distress, this rise in value is not based on any fundamental, intrinsic characteristic. Gold is not easy to transport or store, especially at scale. Try moving $1 billion in gold across an ocean. Due to the large number of industry players, gold is a very centralized commodity, and the price will only be appreciated because of a fluctuating extrinsic value. Someone will see that someone else has gold, and they'll want it.\n\nWhat if everyone thought silver was a better store of value, or tungsten, or rhodium, or zinc… or Bitcoin?\n\n## Bitcoin as Digital Gold\n\nNarratives drive markets as much as fear and uncertainty do. Although gold hasn't been a practical currency in hundreds, if not thousands, of years in most places, big banks, and asset managers still recommend it as a haven asset worthy of 1-5% of a traditional financial nest egg in the off-chance that calamity happens.\n\nThe narrative that it stores its value in times of distress is just that – a narrative. It will work until it doesn't. If rarity or scarcity is the argument, there are more scarce assets on this planet that could replace gold if the narrative shifted—Bitcoin is one of them.\n\nAs proposed in the white paper, Bitcoin was initially conceived as a peer-to-peer method of exchange. It has since become part of the larger store of value narrative to which gold can attribute its declining relevance, except this time—it's digital. Bitcoin has been referred to as Digital Gold by many investors and mainstream media pundits, partially because that's the most digestible explanation they can come up with for its sucess, and partially because it's true.\n\n## Censorship Resistance\n\nSome blockchains, particularly the privacy ones listed above, are intended to resist censorship. The goal is for anyone to build and use them. There are no credit checks; the only requirement to open a digital wallet is an internet connection.\n\nThe reality of censorship resistance in crypto is that some blockchains do a better job than others. The blockchain industry is barely a teenager, and there are many schools of thought regarding how it should operate. Maximalism, tribalism, game theory, and investor bias contribute to a never-ending conversation on which consensus methods and blockchain infrastructure are the most secure and censorship-resistant.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"62:{\"title\":\"Blockchain Foundations\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"Understanding the Building Blocks\",\"tags\":\"$11\",\"image\":\"$12\"}\n60:{\"id\":\"blockchain-foundations\",\"slug\":\"blockchain-foundations\",\"title\":\"Blockchain Foundations\",\"content\":\"$61\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/blockchain-foundations\",\"frontmatter\":\"$62\",\"description\":\"Understanding the Building Blocks\",\"tags\":\"$11\",\"image\":\"$12\"}\n64:T24c3,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nBlockchain technology is gaining traction in Africa, offering innovative solutions to longstanding economic challenges, although no single blockchain has been able to establish a strong footing in the region.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003e \"Are blockchains a solution looking for a problem?\"\n\nThis was Ravi Menon's keynote remark as the Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).

Its population is expected to grow to 2.5 billion by 2050.\n\nProminent players like Nigeria and Seychelles, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mauritius, Kenya, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Tanzania have already made inroads or formally declared their interest in blockchain and fintech industries.\n\n![Graph showing the increase in remittances sent via crypto to Africa over the past few years](/images/ba-1.webp)\n\nNigeria and Seychelles raised over 50% of all blockchain-based venture capital investments on the continent as Africa's YoY VC investment increased by 1100%. Nigeria is also one of the largest oil exporters in the world and has become the wealthiest country in Africa. As oil cruises to near all-time highs, Nigeria collects a pretty penny from energy-dependent countries like India, China, and elsewhere in Africa. While Nigerian millionaires grew by 44% over the past decade, 60% of the country still lives on less than $1 / day, so there is ample room for crypto economies to disrupt the country with the 10th largest GDP and help level the playing field.\n\n## Blockchains as a Solution\n\n### Currencies\n\nWhile blockchain adoption is generally moving in the right direction, it's important to note that many currencies in the region are experiencing unacceptable inflation levels, like the Nigerian Naira, whose annual inflation rate accelerated to 16.82% in April of this year. That doesn't bode well for individuals or corporations who simply need to facilitate transactions or save their money. Blockchains offer a solution to outsource savings from volatile currencies and unstable banking systems to more stable stores of value like USDC, USDT, and other fiat-backed stablecoins. It also provides a framework for fundraising and investment that is transparent and accessible to all.\n\nCurrencies traditionally have acted very similar to languages in that the ones that survive only do so with an army and a navy. Bitcoin changed that. Bitcoin, and blockchains in general, offer new frameworks for global payment rails. Rather than be subject to the volatility of Bitcoin or the more minor domestic currencies that tend to be manipulated by outside forces, African countries can take advantage of both stable coins and interconnected token networks to expand upon their economic progress.\n\n### Remittances\n\nAfrican remittances have nearly been in a perpetual bull market. The following represents the number of remittances sent via crypto to Africa over the past few years.\n\n![Graph showing the increase in remittances sent via crypto to Africa over the past few years](/images/ba-2.webp)\n\nRemittances are payments foreign workers send back home to their families. The remittance industry is a fairly dirty one. Average wiring fees are 7.45%, which equates to over 27 days of a low-income worker's annual income. In 2017, low—and middle-income country remittances amounted to $466 billion, and remittance fees were $34.7 billion. This is not stealing from the rich and giving to the poor; it's quite the opposite.\n\nTo put the dollar value of these fees into perspective, the US's non-military foreign aid budget was $34 billion in 2017.\n\nCrypto does fix this. Using Solana, for example, you can make 1,000,000 transactions for a cost of ~$10. The issue is that banks and vendors in your region may not accept crypto, USDC, or other stablecoins. This is why crypto infrastructure in Africa must improve to facilitate low-fee remittances and benefit from the many other benefits that blockchains enable.\n\n### Debt \u0026 Independence\n\nChina recently banned the holding and transacting of cryptocurrency in preparation for its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). China is also Africa's largest creditor.\n\n![Graph showing China's debt to African countries](/images/ba-3.webp)\n\nTime is a critical component of China's geopolitical strategies. Over the past few decades, Chinese firms have invested extensively in infrastructure projects across the African continent. Many resource-rich but financially developing countries cannot pay their debts, which can lead to several unintended consequences, such as the Chinese government's nationalizing of African public goods.\n\nThe Chinese government has been known to nationalize assets in other countries when it feels that the assets are being used for purposes that are not in the best interests of the Chinese government or its citizens. This has led to concerns about the long-term stability and sovereignty of African countries that have borrowed heavily from China, and it is not an easy problem to fix.\n\nRather than succumb to the external forces that the Chinese government has put on some of the less affluent African countries, blockchains present an alternative financial system for these countries to operate with. Businesses can function globally permissionless, and individuals can self-custody their assets without relying as much on their domestic currency or local banks.\n\n## Blockchains as a Problem\n\nEl Salvador adopted BTC as a domestic currency in June of 2021, and the results have been rather lackluster. At the time of writing, President Nayib Bukele and the El Salvadorian government are down about 30% on their purchase, and citizens are generally unhappy with the situation. Crypto Critics' Corner recorded four podcasts about this situation, and it seems all is not well. Those can be found here - [1](#), [2](#), [3](#), [4](#). Just to note - they are biased no-coiners, so take it with a grain of salt, but to be fair, the IMF recently downgraded El Salvador's credit rating, and the rollout of Bitcoin's Lightning network has been met with significant resistance from vendors and individuals within the country.\n\nIt's also worth considering that Nayib \"deployed the armed forces and civil police around and inside the Legislative Assembly\" to \"coerce the legislative branch to act on his crime bill.\"\n\n![El Salvador Scene](/images/ba-4.webp)\n\nMore recently, the Central African Republic (CAR) made a confusing decision to adopt BTC as a domestic currency this past April. The CAR is ranked 188/189 on the global welfare list, and only 4% of the CAR population has access to the Internet,\n\nOver the past few years, the CAR government has become very close to Putin's regime in Russia after decades of internal strife and external influence from France. French analyst Thierry Vircoulon told the AFP news agency, \"The context, given the systemic corruption and a Russian partner facing international sanctions, does encourage suspicion.\"\n\n![Vibrant river in CAR](/images/ba-5.webp)\n\nTo strawman the other side of the argument, Economist Yann Daworo told BBC Afrique that businesses and individuals \"will no longer have to walk around with suitcases of CFA francs that will have to be converted into dollars or any other currency to purchase abroad.\" This sounds like a cope—will these individuals have to be in the 4% of the country with internet service in order to access their funds? Will the fees associated with transactions on the Bitcoin network eat into CAR citizens' savings? Probably, and yes.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nAs Bitcoin and blockchains are more readily adopted in emerging markets worldwide, the need for scalable, transparent, decentralized networks is becoming more apparent. Still, it needs to be done in ways that benefit the individuals within these markets. Fees on BTC can easily be $5-15 per transaction, which is more than most make in a month in places like the CAR. It's not feasible and is a step backward to have BTC involved when you consider that networks like Solana offer nearly free transacting.\n\nBlockchains are not a panacea. They fix specific problems that are not well understood by the masses, and in their current state, they require a level of financial and technological literacy that is not widespread, so adopters need to be wary of this. In the meantime, Africa continues to invest in blockchain solutions, and builders across the continent continue building.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"65:{\"title\":\"Blockchains in Africa\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"Notes on Adoption Efforts\",\"tags\":\"$14\",\"image\":\"$15\"}\n63:{\"id\":\"blockchains-in-africa\",\"slug\":\"blockchains-in-africa\",\"title\":\"Blockchains in Africa\",\"content\":\"$64\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/blockchains-in-africa\",\"frontmatter\":\"$65\",\"description\":\"Notes on Adoption Efforts\",\"tags\":\"$14\",\"image\":\"$15\"}\n67:T2320,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nNamed after an elementary particle described as a force carrier that functions as the 'glue' holding matter together, Boson Protocol has made its mission to build a decentralized commerce ecosystem to disrupt global trade.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nBoson Protocol is a toolset that gives businesses and individuals the control to engage in trustless transactions of physical goods and services using Ethereum as the underlying settlement layer. It enables the tokenization and redemption of physical items through NFTs, the creation of liquid digital markets for these NFTs, and, as a biproduct, the creation of a robust data market.\n\n\u003e \"Commerce is a human endeavor that should not have value captured by the few.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e — Justin Banon, Boson CEO\n\nThe early Internet promised a future of fair and accessible data for all. Instead, market forces favored centralized infrastructure for its profitability. This trend extended to e-commerce, where intermediaries now dominate. These middlemen often exploit user data for profit or fail to utilize it effectively, hindering the potential for a more open and efficient online marketplace.\n\nWeb3's infrastructure - public blockchains, NFTs, digital wallets, etc. — has given vendors a level of control that wasn't available a decade ago. You no longer need to rely on these intermediaries to perform commerce functions or pay an arm and a leg to keep track of commerce data.\n\n![Boson Protocol 1](/images/bp-1.webp)\n\nInspired by trustless and tokenized DeFi communities, Boson Protocol aims to reduce incumbent rent-seeking behavior by creating a decentralized and trustless environment for commerce. The functionality surrounds what are called Commitment tokens, Thing tokens, and the role of the BOSON token.\n\n### Commitment Tokens\n\nA Buyer and Seller commit to exchange digital value for a physical item (a Thing). This commitment is funded \u0026 tokenized into an escrow contract built into an NFT. The NFT serves as a voucher to buy or sell an item, so Boson refers to them as NFTVs. The NFT contract has an expiration date and, in essence, acts as a futures contract where the Seller is obliged to deliver the said item(s) listed in the contract at expiration. Commitment Token holders are granted the right to transfer their token to another wallet or reliably and securely redeem the token for a particular Thing.\n\n#### Commitment Tokens Characteristics\n\n1. **Universal** - Can represent any Thing.\n2. **Interoperable** - Can represent a standardized version of any Thing.\n3. **Composable** - Can be assembled into composite products.\n4. **Programmable** - Fully customizable within computing limits.\n5. **Transferable / Storable** - Between any standard EVM wallet.\n6. **Stateful** - Appropriately change state across the core exchange mechanism process.\n\nThe Core Exchange Mechanism governs Commitment Tokens, where the programmed game theory comes into play. Buyers and Sellers sequentially deposit up-front funds, so there are varying levels of skin in the game on both sides of the transaction. The final deposit transfer process is structured to incentivize both parties to behave well.\n\nUsing this sequential transaction process, Commitment Tokens can achieve a 'Subgame Perfect Equilibrium,' a concept from game theory. This equilibrium ensures that each transaction step is balanced and fair, reducing the potential for disputes. In simpler terms, it's like a game where each player knows the other players' strategy and has nothing to gain by changing only their strategy, leading to a balanced outcome.\n\n![Boson Protocol 2](/images/bp-2.webp)\n\nThe possible game outcomes are the triangles on the right side of the above diagram. CoF stands for Cancel or Fault, which is an undesirable outcome. The most desirable outcome for all parties is 'Redemption; No Complaint; No CoF,' which is the fourth triangle from the top of the diagram. The purpose of programming this game theory into Commitment Tokens is to minimize the number of disputes and arbitration required between Buyers and Sellers, with the hopes of providing a smooth and efficient transaction process.\n\n### Thing Tokens\n\nThing Tokens, which conform to the standard ERC20 contract, are used to purchase Commitment Tokens. Think of a Thing token as a 'generalized Unisock' and the Commitment Token as an add-on futures contract. Unisocks are a grand experiment in scarcity. There were 500 real pairs of Uniswap merchandise socks tokenized as SOCKs and deposited into a liquidity pool on Uniswap along with their starting value worth of ETH.\n\nEach SOCK token represents the redeemable ownership of 1 pair of socks and is minted with a bonding curve, hence the 11,048.07% increase in price from the original $12. You can either sell the token back to the liquidity pool or redeem it for the physical socks, where the Uniswap company will ship a physical pair to you anywhere in the world.\n\n![Boson Protocol 3](/images/bp-3.webp)\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of a single $SOCK token is $132,576.82, and 192 have already been redeemed. Thing tokens are similar. The interoperability and composability of Thing tokens enable them to be fitted or retrofitted into any existing DeFi infrastructure. They are tradable in the same way you can trade SOCKs between different wallets, and they can 'plug' into AMMs (Automated Market Makers) to create liquid digital markets. Their use cases within DeFi include product price discovery on DEXes, yield optimization, and the crowdfunding of non-existent products through ITOs (Initial Thing Offerings).\n\n### Boson Tokens\n\nIncentives are the invisible hand that Adam Smith was talking about. Boson built reward mechanisms within the Thing / Commitment Token relationship to incentivize good behavior by both Buyers and Sellers - but that doesn't tell the whole story. The core objective of the Boson Protocol is to 'maximize the supply of quality redemptions.' In other words, it facilitates successful commerce transactions. To do so, Boson implemented the BOSON token (Bosons) as a monetary reward for actors within the Boson ecosystem who help the protocol reach its objective. Below is a high-level overview of the main stakeholders within the Protocol.\n\n![Boson Protocol 4](/images/bp-4.webp)\n![Boson Protocol 5](/images/bp-5.webp)\n\n### Gluons\n\nThere's also gluons, which act as quality indicators, encouraging participants to stake more capital for higher-quality items. This system incentivizes market participants to engage in high-quality transactions of high-quality physical goods. Each voucher has a unique derivative called a Gluon that represents the stake of the participant holding the voucher and the associated BOSON reward. Vouchers with higher amounts of Gluons indicate items expected to be higher quality than items with lower amounts of Gluons.\n\n### Applications\n\nUnisocks, unrelated to Boson, is a proof of concept for decentralized commerce of physical goods. While the Boson protocol is built for that, their white paper lists other potential use cases.\n\n1. **Online Commerce**: Decentralized e-commerce platform\n2. **M2M-commerce**: Autonomous machine-to-machine transactions\n3. **Loyalty \u0026 Rewards**: Interoperable, composable reward systems\n4. **Gaming**: Physical rewards for in-game achievements\n5. **Crypto Exchanges**: Token redemption for physical rewards\n6. **Service Bookings**: Permissionless, two-sided deposit bookings\n7. **Tokenized Networks**: Token exchange for goods and services\n\n### Scaling\n\nTo scale, Boson estimates they will need to handle, on average, ten transactions per second, with peaks potentially being more than 10x that. To do so, they decided to utilize the most battle-tested layer 1 - Ethereum, which handles dozens of transactions per second. Boson raised $36,000,000 and hired teams covering protocol design \u0026 architecture, legal, engineering \u0026 game theory. After scaling their team to 50+ Boson purchased $700,000+ in digital real estate within Decentraland's Vegas City with the intention of creating Portal, a lifestyle and commerce playground. Portal will enable creators and brands to sell redeemable NFTs for real-world products and services.\n\n![Boson Protocol 8](/images/bp-8.webp)\n\nNow that funds have been raised, the team assembled, and the strategy set, Boson has entered what it calls \"hyper blitz scale mode\" of development. For a detailed explanation of what hyper-blitz scaling means to Boson, refer to their Roadmap article on Medium. Time will tell if supply chains actually adopt models like this.\n\nLet's hope so.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"68:{\"title\":\"Boson Protocol\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"Tackling dEcommerce\",\"tags\":\"$17\",\"image\":\"$18\"}\n66:{\"id\":\"boson-protocol\",\"slug\":\"boson-protocol\",\"title\":\"Boson Protocol\",\"content\":\"$67\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/boson-protocol\",\"frontmatter\":\"$68\",\"description\":\"Tackling dEcommerce\",\"tags\":\"$17\",\"image\":\"$18\"}\n6a:T1ee4,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\nDeFi ecosystems are built on interconnected layers - from base blockchain networks and scaling solutions, to core infrastructure like smart contracts and tokens, up to financial primitives such as DEXes and lending protocols. These components enable sophisticated financial services that reimagine traditional finance in new ways. In Balaji's words, YouTube is not TV.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\nDefi represents a fundamental shift in how financial services can be delivered - moving from centralized institutions to open, permissionless protocols. This transformation began with Bitcoin in 2009, but it wasn't until Ethereum introduced smart contracts in 2015 that the true potential of DeFi began to emerge.\n\nThe early DeFi experiments started with projects like MakerDAO (2014) and Compound (2018), but the ecosystem remained relatively small until 2020. The catalyst came during \"DeFi Summer\" of 2020, when the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols exploded from $1 billion to over $15 billion in just a few months. This period saw the birth of automated market makers (AMMs) like Uniswap as well as byproducts like yield farming, and liquidity mining.\n\nBy 2021, DeFi had evolved beyond Ethereum to multiple blockchains, each offering their own innovations - and today's DeFi ecosystem represents an interesting opportunity for traditional financial services are being reimagined through code and consensus.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n| Technology            | Description                                                                                                                             | Examples                                       |\n| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| Layer 1               | The underlying blockchain architecture that supports transaction settlement and application development.

The essence of these applications is token utility and interoperability.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nTo start undersanding DeFi, it's essential to understand the fundamental building blocks that make these systems possible. At the core of the crypto ecosystem lies a crucial distinction between different types of digital assets, each serving unique purposes.\n\nThe distinction between coins and tokens, while not strictly technical or universally adopted, provides a helpful framework for understanding crypto assets.\n\n| Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Coins  | Native currencies of blockchains, used to pay transaction fees (like ETH for Ethereum, SOL for Solana, etc.)                                                                         |\n| Tokens | Smart contracts deployed on top of blockchains. Can be either fungible (like ERC20 tokens) or non-fungible (NFTs), each serving different purposes through their programmable nature |\n\n# Smart Contracts and Tokenomics\n\nSmart contracts are self-executing programs that enable token functionality and form the backbone of DeFi applications. The economic design of these tokens, known as Tokenomics, is crucial for their sustainability. Investors analyze factors like vesting schedules and distribution mechanisms to assess token value.\n\n# Stable Coins\n\nStablecoins are among the highest-priority issues in the regulatory landscape. They are intended to retain a peg to another asset, such as a USD and the biggest stablecoins in the world are USDT and USDC, amounting to roughly $100 billion in combined value.\n\nThree variations of stablecoins have gained prominence.\n\n| Type                | Description                                                                                                                                        | Examples               | Risk Level |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |\n| Asset-backed        | Each token is backed by $1 or $1 worth of assets in reserve                                                                                        | USDT, USDC             | Low        |\n| Over-collateralized | Users deposit excess collateral (e.g., $200 worth of BTC for $100 DAI) to mint stablecoins.

While it's possible to peg stablecoins to other values (like 2 USD or even $3.1415926535), most stablecoins focus on maintaining a 1:1 peg with USD. There are also stablecoins pegged to other currencies like EUR and AUD, but USD-based stablecoins dominate in terms of volume and use cases.\n\n# DeFi\n\nIn traditional finance (TradFi), they've built an entire system on layers of trust in intermediaries. The likelihood of nefarious behavior in your banking system really depends on where you live - and Defi seeks to give everyone an equal opportunity at financial sovereignty and independence.\n\nConsider these everyday scenarios in traditional finance:\n\n\u003col class=\"detailed-list\"\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cstrong\u003eBanking Access\u003c/strong\u003e\n        \u003cul\u003e\n            \u003cli\u003eYou trust bank-displayed balances blindly\u003c/li\u003e\n            \u003cli\u003e\n                Banks' hidden actions\n                \u003cul\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eLend your money without notice\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eFreeze your accounts\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eBlock transactions\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003c/li\u003e\n        \u003c/ul\u003e\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cstrong\u003eTrading Integrity\u003c/strong\u003e\n        \u003cul\u003e\n            \u003cli\u003e\n                Required trust points in brokerage trades\n                \u003cul\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eThe broker executing the trade\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eThe clearinghouse processing it\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eThe custodian holding assets\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003c/li\u003e\n        \u003c/ul\u003e\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cstrong\u003ePayment Processing\u003c/strong\u003e\n        \u003cul\u003e\n            \u003cli\u003e\n                Trust points in card transactions\n                \u003cul\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eThe merchant's payment processor\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eThe card network\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eYour bank's authorization\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003c/li\u003e\n        \u003c/ul\u003e\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cstrong\u003eFinancial Services\u003c/strong\u003e\n        \u003cul\u003e\n            \u003cli\u003e\n                Areas of gatekeeper control\n                \u003cul\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eWho can access financial services\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eWhat transactions are allowed\u003c/li\u003e\n                    \u003cli\u003eWhen funds can be moved\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003c/li\u003e\n        \u003c/ul\u003e\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"prose\"\u003e\n\n### The Global Trust Divide\n\nIn developed economies, trust in financial institutions is often taken for granted. However, recent history has shown that no financial system is immune to crisis:\n\n#### Developing Economies Face:\n\n- Hyperinflation and currency collapses (Venezuela, Zimbabwe)\n- Sudden bank nationalizations\n- Rampant financial corruption\n- Arbitrary asset seizures and capital controls\n- Limited access to basic banking services\n\n#### Developed Economies Experience:\n\n- Bank runs and failures (2008 Financial Crisis)\n- Account freezes during political unrest\n- Payment censorship\n- Trading halts during market volatility\n- Negative interest rates on savings accounts\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Price Action Preceding Innovation\n\nEthereum paved the way for decentralized projects to bootstrap their funding rounds by issuing tokens in their 2014 ICO (Initial Coin Offering), leading to the ICO mania in 2017. Much has been documented about this time period as it was rife with scams and bewitching celebrities attempting cash grabs while the price of Ethereum soared to nearly $1500 and Bitcoin to almost $20,000.\n\nIn the following years, Ethereum crashed to less than $100, and Bitcoin fell to $3200 during the COVID drop in March 2020. Then it was up only, down only, then up only, and yada yada.\n\nPrice movements historically drive public interest in cryptocurrency. While the 2020 DeFi Summer coincided with Bitcoin's dramatic price recovery, this correlation mainly affected user adoption. Behind the scenes, developers had been consistently building and improving DeFi infrastructure since 2017, regardless of market conditions.\n\n# Defi Summer \u0026 The Standard Stack\n\nAs Bitcoin and Ethereum recovered during the remainder of 2020 after the COVID drop in March, something called DeFi Summer took off. This movement has been in the background since 2017. Protocols like Uniswap, MakerDAO, Curve, Yearn, and Aave took off on Ethereum, enabling the world's first decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading markets.\n\nThis period was rampant with innovation and, at the same time, speculation. Prices were rising at unsustainable rates, and some protocols were failing while their tokens were going to zero. Ecosystems have collectively evolved to establish a core set of essential financial services that are now considered fundamental building blocks.\n\nThese services typically include:\n\n1. Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) for token swapping\n2. Lending and borrowing protocols\n3. Liquidity pools and yield farming\n4. Stablecoin mechanisms\n5. Asset bridging solutions\n\nThey form what's known as the \"DeFi stack\" - a foundational layer that new blockchains must implement to be considered viable for modern decentralized applications. When a new blockchain launches, developers typically prioritize building these core services first, which explains why you'll find similar protocols (like Uniswap-style DEXes or Aave-like lending platforms) replicated across different blockchain ecosystems.\n\n# Case Study\n\nTo truly understand crypto, you need to participate in on-chain transactions.\n\nLet's compare aspects of the trade process at ETrade, one of the world's largest centralized exchanges (CEX), vs. Jupiter Aggregator, Solana's most advanced decentralized exchange (DEX). Jupiter is not just a DEX; it is an aggregator of different DEXes.\n\nIf you submit a trade and Jupiter finds two ways to do it, you'll be presented with the option that offers the better deal.\n\n## ETrade vs Jupiter Aggregator Comparison\n\n| Feature          | ETrade (CEX)                                                  | Jupiter (DEX)                  |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Account Setup    | Complex account opening process (documentation, verification) | Simple wallet connection       |\n| Trading Timeline | Multi-day waiting periods                                     | Immediate trading capability   |\n| Availability     | Limited trading hours                                         | 24/7 operation                 |\n| Custody          | Centralized custody and market makers                         | Non-custodial                  |\n| Market Making    | Payment for order flow (PFOF) model                           | Automated market makers (AMMs) |\n\n# Conclusion\n\nDeFi is powerful, yet it is still only a toddler, and there are growing pains. There have been dozens, if not hundreds, of blockchain applications and exploits, and if you want to get involved, you need to know what you're doing. The remainder of this course focuses on the media's media's buzzwords – NFTs and DAOs. What is essential to consider is these sub-industries within crypto are just logical extensions of what DeFi can do.\n\nConsensus methods are the foundation of blockchains.\n\nBlockchains are the foundations of DeFi.\n\nDeFi is the foundation of everything else.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"6e:{\"title\":\"Defi\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"Global, Permissionless Finance\",\"tags\":\"$1d\",\"image\":\"$1e\"}\n6c:{\"id\":\"defi\",\"slug\":\"defi\",\"title\":\"Defi\",\"content\":\"$6d\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/defi\",\"frontmatter\":\"$6e\",\"description\":\"Global, Permissionless Finance\",\"tags\":\"$1d\",\"image\":\"$1e\"}\n70:T2be5,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nDerivative markets significantly influence equity prices through market-maker actions. Real asset values differ from notional values due to monetary policy and market mechanics. While crypto markets are less affected by derivatives, they face unique challenges from well capitalized traders, resulting in illiquidity and volatility.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nThe recent S\u0026P 500 futures (/ES) movement presents an interesting case study:\n\n\u003col className=\"list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2\"\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLarge traders, reportedly including Carl Icahn, accumulated significant positions in 4050 puts\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe market declined to precisely 4050 by expiration\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSubsequently, these traders established new positions in 3950 puts for the following month\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAnd sure enough - the market dropped again\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\nThe relationship between large options positions and market movements can appear to be more than coincidental. While it's impossible to definitively prove causation, the mechanics of dealer hedging combined with market psychology create conditions where large derivative positions can significantly influence the price action of spot assets.\n\nWhy is that? Let's look into it.\n\n## Market Structure\n\nOne largely overlooked aspect of retail trading is market structure. Predicting when to buy/sell is where billions are made, and having a thorough understanding of the market structure and how big players are positioned, or how big positions are played, is one of the market's most predictive resources.\n\nMarket Structure encompasses all market characteristics, such as the number and size of buyers and sellers, competition level, information availability, regulatory environment, and the physical and virtual infrastructures where financial instruments are traded. All of which can significantly affect market efficiency, price discovery, and overall price trajectory.\n\nDuring Covid times, 'gamma squeezes' became a colloquial term on financial news channels. They represent the phenomenon of dealer positioning (Gary), an inevitable result of how equity markets are structured. In short, a 'gamma squeeze' occurs when the acceleration of upside derivative purchases increases, leading to the purchasing of the underlying by cash-heavy dealers, resulting in exponential rises in price, as seen in Gamestop and AMC. When you buy derivatives that profit on the upside on an asset (going long), a dealer can sell you the derivative (going short) and hedge against that by buying the underlying, which is the asset.\n\nWhen the acceleration of upside derivative purchases increases, so does the purchasing of the underlying by cash-heavy dealers, resulting in exponential rises in price, as seen in Gamestop and AMC. Monitoring the call or put volume before a gamma squeeze could give actionable insights on how to trade it.\n\nThis is what a gamma squeeze looks like.\n\n![Derivatives vs Spot](/images/derivatives-1.webp)\n\n### Consequences of 1987\n\nHow can these dealers be so involved when they impact the market so much? The answer is liquidity. Some market-making dealers are legally obliged to place bids under specific market conditions. This is meant to protect the infrastructure and price stability of the underlying and became standard practice after the 1987 crash, which resulted from an overcrowded trade in portfolio insurance. Some traders like Paul Tudor Jones made a killing by being on the right side of this and once the dust settled, the market nearly went up only until the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s.\n\n![Derivatives vs Spot](/images/derivatives-2.webp)\n\nThe crash was a technical reaction to how the market was structured. - there was no fundamental change that provoked the price collapse. Simply put, there were not enough market-making firms willing to place a bid on that frightful morning. Regulators deemed that unacceptable, and market makers have since become one of the primary driving forces of global markets - to a fault.\n\nThe arguably black swan events of 2008 and 2020 were two moments when this market-making backstop failed. In both cases, price conditions were so dire that there seemed to be no buyers left - until the central banks made their money printing intentions clear, as they have time and again.\n\n## Notional Value vs. Real Value\n\nBelow is a graph of the S\u0026P 500 index (traded as /ES) priced in USD.\n\n![Derivatives vs Spot](/images/derivatives-3.webp)\n\nNow compare the index against the Fed's balance sheet.\n\n![Derivatives vs Spot](/images/derivatives-4.webp)\n\nAs you can see, the value of the index in 2007/2008 was around 0.0016. So for every $1 on the Fed's balance sheet, ~$0.0016 of value existed in the S\u0026P 500 index. Quantitative easing and bank bailouts brought floods of new capital into the system and onto the Fed's balance sheet, pushing the value of the index to the $0.0004/0.0006 territory.\n\nThe index has not even come close to its previous highs in relative real value. Meanwhile, a steep rise exists in the USD notional value. This leads to the forgone conclusion that each unit of USD is effectively losing its real value over time.\n\nIn other words, prices are rising. Real value can be measured by a notional value less inflation which results in spending power, but how do we measure inflation? You can listen to what the Fed reports in its CPI numbers, or you can measure your purchases.\n\n### Candy is not a Store of Value\n\n| Product                  | 2014 Weight | 2018 Weight | Change |\n| ------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------ |\n| Snickers (4 pack)        | 232g        | 167g        | -28.1% |\n| Toblerone Milk Chocolate | 200g        | 150g        | -25.0% |\n| Twix Twin Bars (4 pack)  | 200g        | 160g        | -20.0% |\n| Kit Kat Chunky           | 48g         | 40g         | -16.7% |\n\nThe notional value of these candies has not changed, yet the real value of what you are purchasing has declined substantially. This pattern of decreasing returns and increasing prices is common across many industries, such as education, groceries, commodities, ride-sharing services, and streaming platforms. It is not a specific issue, it's a systemic problem.\n\nTo be clear, its probably a good thing that we're getting less candy than before but prices should reflect that reality.\n\n## Asset Scarcity\n\nScarcity, physical or digital, has made its way to the front lines of the debate on asset valuation. One thing is certain: the US dollar is not scarce, nor are the derivatives tied to it.\n\nAccording to Visualise Capitalist's research on the world's money supply, the global derivatives markets outside the world's stock markets by a factor of 11.\n\nA conservative estimate of the notional value of the world's derivative markets is one quadrillion US dollars.\n\nIf that estimate is correct, then for every $1 in a stock market, there are $11 in derivatives betting on what that $1 does. These $11 serve a variety of purposes, such as supply-side hedging, but most are cash-settled speculations. These are side-bets, bets on side-bets, and bets on bets on side-bets. Each of these carry their own risk profiles but are ultimately tied to that first $1.\n\nThe thesis here is the sheer quantity of the value of side bets changes how the initial bet plays out.\n\nIt's similar to the reflexivity principle discussed by George Soros in his book the Alchemy of Finance (read my review here) or the concept of Gary as described by TV-friendly market maker and fund manager Cem Karsan. GO INTO DETAIL ON GARY HERE AND LINK SQUEEZE PAPER\n\n## Reflexivity: The Observer Effect\n\nPhysicists deal with the same issues of reflexivity as financial markets, but in a more fundamental sense — the observer effect.\n\n\"In physics, the observer effect is the disturbance of an observed system by the act of observation. This is often the result of instruments that, by necessity, alter the state of what they measure in some manner. A common example is checking the pressure in an automobile tire; this is difficult to do without letting out some air, thus changing the pressure. Similarly, it is not possible to see any object without light hitting the object and causing it to reflect that light. While the effects of observation are often negligible, the object still experiences a change.\"\n\nFinancial markets are dynamic entities with an infinitely complex combination of observers and their intentions. This observer effect is compounded through the use of derivatives.\n\n## Crypto Market Structure\n\nThings are slightly different in crypto.\n\nThe whales in the equity markets are traditionally risk-averse like endowmnets, pension funds, and even market makers while the whales in crypto are often early adopters playing with house money, emerging funds, or individual traders with a large risk tolerance. I go into more depth on this risk tolerance in Easy Money \u0026 Veblen Goods.\n\nThese dynamics create sustained volatility unmatched in traditional equity markets, aside from perhaps penny stocks or OTC stocks where market caps are small, and majority share owners can, at least temporarily, get away with acting shady to pump or dump prices.\n\n## So, which is the real underlying asset?\n\nIts hard to tell and in crypto, it's definitely not clear. Crypto derivatives are relatively niche compared to equity derivatives, and their notional value is far lower. The existence of multiple crypto futures exchanges, funding rates, on-chain activity and other factors muddy the answer.\n\nFor example, there have been times when Bitcoin futures traded 10% higher on Coinbase than on other exchanges. This doesn't happen to SPX futures on the single exchange (CME), where all /ES futures contracts are traded. Bitcoin's premium has been as high as 20% in South Korea due to restrictions on foreigners trading the South Korean Won — it eventually gets arbitraged out or resets to equilibrium, but that is a non-existent phenomenon in equity markets and shouldn't happen.\n\nThe lack of standardized futures contracts and the use of many different price oracles in cryptocurrency markets creates a complex and uncorrelated web of price data that has yet to be demonstrated to have the same impact on crypto spot transactions as in traditional markets.\n\nAs crypto derivatives markets mature, will they become as reflexive as equity markets?\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    Having the ability to go long or short an asset:\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eLong = You buy the asset and make money when the price goes up\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eShort = You sell the asset and make money when the price goes down\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    Understanding market structure:\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eNumber and size of buyers and sellers\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eCompetition level and information availability\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eRegulatory environment\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"71:{\"title\":\"Derivatives vs Spot\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"Market Structure \u0026 Price Discovery\",\"tags\":\"$20\",\"image\":\"$21\"}\n6f:{\"id\":\"derivatives-vs-spot\",\"slug\":\"derivatives-vs-spot\",\"title\":\"Derivatives vs Spot\",\"content\":\"$70\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/derivatives-vs-spot\",\"frontmatter\":\"$71\",\"description\":\"Market Structure \u0026 Price Discovery\",\"tags\":\"$20\",\"image\":\"$21\"}\n73:T24a6,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\nA concise summary of how crypto wealth has influenced economic behaviors, particularly around Veblen goods—luxury items that become more desirable as they get more expensive. From NFTs to gas fees, crypto markets are driven by psychology and perceived value.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nWith a low of $0.00099 https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/price/ and an all-time high of $68,958.00 https://calendar.bitbo.io/price/, Bitcoin increased in value by 6,965,454,545.45% between 2010 and 2021—just a casual 69,654,545.4545x. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been raised to support the burgeoning blockchain industry, and cryptocurrencies have surpassed $3.3 trillion in total market capitalization at their peak. According to Chainalysis, over $160 billion https://x.com/zacharyr0th/status/1517988266569523201 in crypto gains was realized in 2021 ($76.3b in ETH, $74.7b in BTC, and $11.7b in all altcoins). It's easy to understand how many millionaires and billionaires were freshly minted during this time. All this money needs to go somewhere.\n\nThe newest money crowd wields newfound power that wasn't possible until a few years ago. Blockchains and non-custodial wallets let anyone take full control of their financial assets in an unprecedented practice known as self-custody. Assets are no longer custodied by banks or investment firms; rather, they remain decentralized, on-chain assets globally trading in liquid markets 24 hours a day. The ability to 100x or -100% on a portfolio has never been easier.\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchain technology have relatively higher barriers to entry than traditional finance, which is already a convoluted subject to understand. Between developers, entrepreneurs, traders, venture capital funds, hedge funds, quantitative trading firms, and absolute beginners, informational asymmetry levels can continuously be exploited as new participants and unaudited protocols enter the market. As a result, there are always opportunities for more money to be made.\n\n## Where Will All This Money Go?\n\nNow that it's clear there is a lot of crypto money out there, and it has to go somewhere, consider the anthropological and psychological aspects of what blockchain technologies are enabling. NFTs, DAOs, airdrops, and on-chain governance are bringing people worldwide together to work towards similar goals or participate in incentivized networks and communities.\n\nThis, along with the newfound generational wealth, results in several exciting behaviors between groups of strangers.\n\n## Normal Goods \u0026 Discretionary Spending\n\nEveryday goods are purchased more often when incomes rise, and discretionary spending refers to purchasing non-essential items.\n\nBelow are some examples of discretionary spending on everyday goods.\n\n- Buying the newest iPhone when your current one works fine\n- Buying an expensive latte machine when your drip coffee maker works fine\n- Going on vacation\n\nMost high-quality items are normal goods. Inferior goods, on the other hand, are items that you buy less of as your income rises. These are usually cheap substitutes for normal goods like knock-off clothing brands and low-quality food.\n\n## Veblen Goods, Luxury Items, \u0026 Mimetic Desire\n\nWhen you reach the high end of the price spectrum on normal goods like cars, clothes, pens, watches, NFTs, etc., rules change. These normal goods turn into something else entirely – Veblen goods. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/veblen-good.asp\n\nVeblen goods are items that get more valuable as their prices increase.\n\nThink about the white cotton T-shirt from TJMaxx that sells for $5 and compare it to the white cotton T-shirt from Prada that sells for $500. While there may be negligible differences in material, the Prada insignia is on the Prada shirt. With that insignia comes clout and cultural significance. Prada stands for something cool, and anyone who wears Prada is cool, right?\n\nThis type of social engineering is a large part of what drives the prices of luxury items skyward, and NFTs are a prime example. A long list of reasons drives people to NFTs, but very often, it is either for the idea of buying something for X and selling it to someone for X+Y, the concept of being and owning a part of a community, or both. So, how can you value an NFT or a set of NFTs? If you ask many of the most successful crypto traders, they would tell you to follow the cult.\n\nNotice they aren't recommending you join the cult. Instead, you observe which communities are the most cultish in their behavior and position investments accordingly. This can be carried across cryptocurrencies and NFTs, but it is especially prevalent in NFTs.\n\nNFTs are valued at whatever someone else will pay. If there are 10,000 items in a set of NFTs and 20,000 people want to own one or more of them, that creates an imbalance that can only be resolved with rising prices. People notice the price going up and want to get in on it. This increases the price even more until there is a capitulation event, the average buyer is priced out, and the price starts trending down.\n\nMimetic desire is an interesting way to frame this dynamic.\n\nMany crypto and market publications have discussed this topic at great length, but it's worth exploring to give a sense of how psychological phenomena can drive price action.\n\n### Mimetic Desire\n\nMimetic desire is best explained with an analogy. Imagine you are standing next to someone on a trampoline. That person sees something they want that requires them to jump to reach it. When they jump, you feel the movement of the trampoline underneath you. A natural reaction is to look at where this movement is coming from. When you see the thing that the person next to you wants, the Mimetic theory argues that you'll start to want that thing, too.\n\nLearn more about it here. https://read.lukeburgis.com/\n\nBaby behaviors are often used to describe the effects of mimetic desire. If you observe a room of 5 babies and five toys, the first baby that grabs the first toy will make that first toy an object of desire for the other four babies. All of a sudden, the other four babies will want that particular toy for themselves even though four perfectly available toys are lying around the room.\n\nGiven the previous examples, the final one is ironic – markets are bastions of mimetic desire.\n\nWhy do people flock to gold when financial times get rough and when more rare earth metals are out there? Why are people buying 3 million dollar images of cartoon apes when other cartoon NFTs are out there?\n\nIn short, because other people are doing it.\n\n## Ethereum'sEthereum's Gas as a Veblen Good\n\nOne can argue that even Ethereum's transaction fees have become a Veblen good.\n\nA quote of $7,287.36 for a transaction fee.\nGiven that most entrants in NFTs are, on average, newcomers to crypto and that newcomers typically value UI/UX and low fees over decentralization, why are the most expensive NFTs on Ethereum when other chains like Avalanche and Near offer just as adequate onboarding experiences and lower fees?\n\nAn answer could be that Ethereum is the original Turing-complete Infinite Machine or that only people who can afford to transact on Ethereum can own Ethereum NFTs. Unless you are in it for the relative decentralization—which many are not—trading on Ethereum can now be considered a Veblen act since there are cheaper options to deploy and purchase NFTs.\n\n## In Conclusion: It's All Psychology\n\nWhen economies bust, discretionary spending goes down. When economies boom, some normal goods transform into Veblen goods. As prices go higher, people notice. As people notice, more people buy, and prices balloon even higher—until they don't.\n\nIf BTC is up 5%, some people will buy, but many will feel like they'll have a chance to buy at a similar price later, so they don't have to buy now. If BTC is up 20%, these same people may feel like they won't be able to pay less than the current price, so they buy now. The same goes for selling.\n\nThere are 2nd and 3rd order effects to every decision. Basing your trading decisions on how you perceive other people will react will place you one step ahead of the traders simply reacting. Then, take a step back and think about basing your trading decisions on how you perceive how other people will perceive other people reacting.\n\nThen take another step back… and another …\n\nMicro and macro versions of this phenomenon occur every moment in crypto'scrypto's 24/7 markets.\n\nIt's fractal.\n\nThere is endless FOMO and endless opportunities to get rekt, but there are also infinite possibilities.\n\nSolflare is here to help you through this journey by allowing you to securely open decentralized bank accounts and investment accounts—AKA blockchain wallets—on the world's highest-performing blockchain. Solrise, our other product, is an extension of that framework, where anyone in the world can open a fund and permissionlessly invest in an on-chain fund.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"74:{\"title\":\"Easy Money and Veblen Goods\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"The Reflexivity of Value\",\"tags\":\"$23\",\"image\":\"$24\"}\n72:{\"id\":\"easy-money-and-veblen-goods\",\"slug\":\"easy-money-and-veblen-goods\",\"title\":\"Easy Money and Veblen Goods\",\"content\":\"$73\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/easy-money-and-veblen-goods\",\"frontmatter\":\"$74\",\"description\":\"The Reflexivity of Value\",\"tags\":\"$23\",\"image\":\"$24\"}\n76:T1c80,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nKernel access is a powerful capability that allows software to interact directly with an operating system's core.

It made me wonder which applications need kernel access and which ones could get by with only user-mode access.\n\n### Hidden in plain sight\n\nThe following is a list of applications that may require kernel access. A good rule of thumb is to limit kernel access to only the most necessary applications.\n\n| Application                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Anti-Cheat Software             | Anti-cheat software utilizes kernel-level access to monitor real-time game processes, system memory, and hardware interactions.

This allows for accurate monitoring of CPU frequencies, temperatures, voltages, and other hardware metrics. For overclocking tools, kernel-mode operation enables manipulation of hardware settings beyond what's possible in user mode.                                                                              |\n| Remote Access Software          | Some remote access solutions use kernel-level components to enhance functionality, security, and performance.

Kernel-mode VPN components can bypass user-mode processing to provide better throughput and lower latency. They can also offer stronger security by intercepting network traffic at a lower level, though this deep integration also increases the potential security risk if the VPN software is compromised. |\n| Development and Debugging Tools | Development and debugging tools may utilize kernel-level access to provide essential low-level system access and debugging capabilities for system-level programming, driver development, and operating system internals analysis. These tools can inspect and modify kernel memory, set hardware breakpoints, and analyze system crashes.                                                                                                                       |\n\n## Be Aware\n\nWhile kernel access provides powerful capabilities, it's important to recognize the risks involved. The path of least resistance is not always the most straightforward or most secure, and a handful of incumbent kernel architectures will dominate the market in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn the meantime, there is plenty of room for innovation in the kernel design space. I'm most interested in multi-layered kernel designs that can provide the performance of a monolithic kernel with the security and modularity of a microkernel. There may also be a demand for kernels specifically designed for a real-time data processing use case, such as high-frequency trading or blockchain validation.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"77:{\"title\":\"Kernel Access\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"Everything You Need to Worry About\",\"tags\":\"$26\",\"image\":\"$27\"}\n75:{\"id\":\"kernel-access\",\"slug\":\"kernel-access\",\"title\":\"Kernel Access\",\"content\":\"$76\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/kernel-access\",\"frontmatter\":\"$77\",\"description\":\"Everything You Need to Worry About\",\"tags\":\"$26\",\"image\":\"$27\"}\n79:T1ae0,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nLiquidity pools enabled new forms of decentralized finance by eliminating the need for market makers, providing liquidity to otherwise illiquid markets, and offering new yield-generating opportunities.

When trading, users place limits or market orders, which are executed at the best available price.\n\n### Liquidity Pools\n\nLiquidity pools, in contrast, operate on different principles. They are smart-contract-based token reserves that enable decentralized trading and yield generation. Liquid pools offer several advantages over traditional order book systems by automating the trading process and removing intermediaries.\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eBenefit\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eDescription\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eContinuous Liquidity\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003ePools provide constant liquidity, allowing trades to occur anytime without relying on matching buyers and sellers.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eSimplified Trading\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eUsers can swap tokens directly against the pool, eliminating the need to navigate complex order books.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eYield Generation\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eLiquidity providers earn fees by depositing assets into the pool, creating new passive income opportunities.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMarket Accessibility\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003ePools enable trading for less popular or new tokens that might struggle to maintain liquidity in traditional markets.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n## The Issue with CLOBs\n\nA typical central limit order book (CLOB) contains a labyrinth of intermediaries lurking beneath this seemingly efficient system. Traditional finance (TradFi) or centralized finance (CeFi) is a bureaucratic beast, requiring a small army of entities to execute a single trade. We're talking centralized exchanges (CEXes), market makers, deep-pocketed prime brokers, custodians, and others. This complex web creates a financial fortress with sky-high entry barriers and rampant information asymmetry.\n\nImagine you're looking to buy 150 Apple shares for $130 each, but there are only 50 shares up for grabs at that price, and the next batch is waiting to be bought at $131. Enter the market maker. These financial intermediaries conjure up liquidity and will happily provide those extra 100 shares, but don't expect charity - you'll be paying a premium for the privilege of accessing that trade at that exact moment in time.\n\n### Implications of Market Makers\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eImplication\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eDescription\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThe Information Advantage\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMarket makers gain a significant edge through their privileged position in the order book structure.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThe True Cost of \"Free\" Trading\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eWhile platforms like Robinhood tout commission-free trading, there's more to the story.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eMarket Distortions\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThe symbiotic relationship between market makers and the broader market can lead to unnatural price movements.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n### Enter Liquidity Pools: A Decentralized Alternative\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eFeature\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eDescription\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eNo Middlemen\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eThey operate without the need for traditional market makers, cutting out intermediaries.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eDemocratized Liquidity Provision\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eAnyone can become a liquidity provider by depositing tokens into a smart contract.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eAutomated Trading\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eSwaps occur directly with the pool, governed by smart contracts.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eProportional Rewards\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eLiquidity providers earn fees in proportion to their share of the pool.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eFlexibility\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eProviders can exit by burning their LP tokens to reclaim their share of the pool plus accumulated fees.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n## The AMM Formula: A Financial Balancing Act\n\nAt the heart of liquidity pools lies a deceptively simple formula: \\( x \\* y = k \\)\n\n- \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) represent the quantities of two tokens in the pool.\n- \\( k \\) is a constant that represents the pool's total liquidity.\n\nThis formula ensures that as one token's quantity decreases, its price increases, maintaining a delicate balance within the pool.\n\nAny price discrepancy between the pool and external markets creates an arbitrage opportunity. Bots and savvy traders pounce on these differences, ensuring the pool's prices align with the broader market.\n\n## Risks\n\nLiquidity pools allow users to trade trustlessly on decentralized exchanges (DEXes) with nothing more than a non-custodial digital wallet but to be clear, DeFi is still an experimental technology at scale, and venturing into it exposes you to new, unavoidable risks.\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eRisk\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003cth\u003eDescription\u003c/th\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eSmart Contract Bugs\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eEven audited contracts can harbor nasty surprises.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eAdmin Key Risk\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eToo much-centralized control can put your assets in jeopardy.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eSystemic Risk\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eFrom blockchain failures to stablecoin de-pegging, systemic shocks loom large.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eImpermanent Loss\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003ePotential loss from price fluctuations of assets in a liquidity pool compared to holding them outside the pool.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite these challenges, liquidity pools represent a powerful alternative to the fee-laden, opaque world of traditional finance.

This hierarchical structure ensures that a single mnemonic phrase can generate an extensive array of wallet accounts, always producing the same sequence when input.\n\n1. Mnemonic Phrase: The root of the hierarchy\n2. Private Keys: Derived from the mnemonic phrase\n3. Public Keys: Generated from private keys\n4. Wallet Addresses: Derived from public keys\n\n## BIP: Standardizing Mnemonic Phrases\n\nThe concept of mnemonic phrases was introduced and standardized through Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), specifically BIP39. These proposals have had a lasting impact on the cryptocurrency ecosystem, with many other blockchain networks adopting similar standards, including Ethereum and Solana.\n\n## How Mnemonic Phrases Work\n\n1. Generation: A wallet creates a random sequence of words from a predefined list.\n2. Conversion: The phrase is converted into a binary seed through key stretching.\n3. Key Derivation: The seed generates the master private and subsequent child keys.\n4. Address Creation: Public keys and addresses are derived from these private keys.\n\n- Human-Readable: Easier to record and remember than long strings of characters.\n- Versatility: A single phrase can access multiple accounts across various cryptocurrencies.\n- Security: Properly stored phrases provide robust protection against unauthorized access.\n\nPhysical Storage: Write the phrase on paper or engrave it on metal; avoid digital storage.\nMultiple Copies: Store copies in different secure locations to prevent loss.\nConfidentiality: Never share your mnemonic phrase with anyone.\nVerification: Regularly verify the integrity and readability of your stored phrase.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### Private Keys\n\nA private key is a unique code granting access to a digital wallet containing cryptocurrencies or NFTs. It's comparable to a safety deposit box key or email password. Access is typically through mnemonic phrases or keystore files.\n\n### Public Keys\n\nPublic keys are associated with blockchain accounts and digital wallets. They're used as addresses for receiving tokens, similar to email addresses for receiving messages.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### The BIP-39 Process\n\nEntropy – or randomness, is encoded in multiples of 32 bits. A bit is a single unit of information with a value of 1 or 0. The bits are split into groups and are then encoded with a number ranging from 0-2047. These numbers are cross-referenced with a word list, and a mnemonic sentence is born. This sentence is converted into a mnemonic seed phrase using the PBKDF2 hash function, which helps reduce the effectiveness of brute-force attacks. For a more detailed explanation of this process, refer to BIP-39's documentation.\n\n### BIP-32 \u0026 BIP-44\n\nUsing elliptic curve cryptography, one can calculate a public key without revealing the private key. The single private key can also generate a nearly infinite set of public keys, each accessible by various derivation paths required for a wallet to hold more than one token.\n\nFor most users, accessing more than a digital wallet's recommended derivation path is unnecessary. Most wallets' user interfaces either do not require a derivation specification or give users the option to choose which derivation path to access—often with the option to select a recommended path.\n\nEach token has its derivation path. If users were required to access each asset in a multi-asset wallet individually, this could become cumbersome. Instead, BIP-32 introduced the ability of a single private key to unlock more than one public key.\n\nBIP-44 defines the specific hierarchy to use as described by an algorithm detailed in BIP-32. This means that different derivations of a wallet will comply with the following format:\n\nm/purpose'/coin_type'/account'/change/address_index\n\nHierarchical deterministic wallets are identified with the BIP-44 reference under purpose'.\n\nFor example, m/44'/60/' 0'/1’/8′ = The 9th address at change level 1 (addresses begin at 0).\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nBefore BIP-32, burdensome tasks and financially insecure practices regarding digital wallets and derivation paths prevented many people who needed to be computer-savvy from participating.\n\nOnce BIP-32, 39, and 44 were widely implemented, users could access nearly a limitless number of digital assets (tokens and NFTs) from one user-friendly mnemonic device. Thank BIP-32, 39, and 44.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n### Core BIP Documentation\n\n- [BIP-32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) - Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets\n- [BIP-39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki#Generating_the_mnemonic) - Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys\n- [BIP-44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) - Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets\n- [BIP-39 Word Lists](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md)\n- [English Word List](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt)\n- [Chinese Word List](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/chinese_simplified.txt)\n- [From Mnemonic Phrase to Address](https://blog.mycrypto.com/the-journey-from-mnemonic-phrase-to-address)\n- [PBKDF2 Hash Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2)\n- [Brute-force Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack)\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"7d:{\"title\":\"Mnemonic Phrases\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"AKA Seed Phrases\",\"tags\":\"$2c\",\"image\":\"$2d\"}\n7b:{\"id\":\"mnemonic-phrases\",\"slug\":\"mnemonic-phrases\",\"title\":\"Mnemonic Phrases\",\"content\":\"$7c\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/mnemonic-phrases\",\"frontmatter\":\"$7d\",\"description\":\"AKA Seed Phrases\",\"tags\":\"$2c\",\"image\":\"$2d\"}\n7f:T10d9,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nI'm building MusicIDE, which will directly incorporate advanced music theory and LLMs into a Cursor/Musescore/Synthesia-like software.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nWith the advent of LLMs and AI wrappers, the barriers to entry in the world of technology are breaking. As Chamath put it, the future will not be governed by people who are good at memorizing things and manually doing laborious computations but rather by tastemakers. Tastemakers know what they want because they've seen what they don't. Unfortunately, when money gets involved, sellouts become a problem. True tastemakers create trends and drive innovation by sticking to their actual tastes rather than catering to their corporate sponsors or audiences. In other words, the more personal something is, the more universal it is.\n\n### Notation Landscape\n\nDominant notation software like Sibelius is limited, static, and requires meticulous attention to detail throughout every step of the process. To substitute a Db Neopolitan 6 chord in first inversion across 18 instruments for the dominant chord in a symphonic score, the chord must be diagnosed, and each note must be inputted individually across the instruments. Editing this on paper is one thing, but in a notation program, it's so annoying. Keyboard shortcuts and MIDI input help, but we need more.\n\nWith MusicIDE, a goal is to be able to prompt the system to do this in the same way that Cursor does - to generate and apply all the changes while giving me the option to further edit the changes before accepting them. This tool will know that you're in the key of C and will generate a Db chord with an F in the bass. To do that, it needs to understand what a Neopolitan chord is, what the six means, what the notes are in every key, and be able to substitute the current notes for the new ones across all the instruments. Traditionalists will say this is blasphemy, and they have a point but this isnt traditional music composition.\n\n### Generated Music?\n\nHow will all the other notes be input? Will there be parallel 5ths that bring horror to every music teacher in the hearing distance? Will appogiaturas be considered? Does the counterpoint make sense? Why is this note here instead of there? These are valid questions and should be considered because every choice matters in music, but non-determinism has been thoroughly investigated in the realm of composition and, in some sense, having the voicing/counterpoint/music/etc. being generated is just an extension of the non-deterministic outputs famous composers have used for over a century. We don't know precisely how these AI models work, so we can't predict their exact output - for better or worse.\n\nGenerated is the right word to use, but MusicIDE is going to be much more than a generative AI wrapper. It will also feature exhaustive permutations of music concepts and references to historical examples of those concepts. This can help accelerate learning, researching, and writing music in ways that will be easier to explain in future articles once demos are made available.\n\n### Applications\n\nThe overarching goal is to aid individuals in Music Research and Composition by giving everyone the compositional and analytical tools that history's greatest musicologists, musicians, and composers have been working with.\n\nThis means every open-source score, textbook, concept from music theory, and analytical resource can be built into the program to be used as context for learning, researching, and composing music. The longer-term roadmap for MusicIDE includes tools to learn music on the instrument of your choosing with the help of AR and guitar-hero-inspired visuals for the piano.\n\nIts important to emphasize that while AI is useful for generating templates, boilerplates, ideas, and implementations of ideas - ultimately the choices of AI-assisted composers is by the human - the tastemaker.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"80:{\"title\":\"MusicIDE\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"Cursor + Musescore for Research + Composition\",\"tags\":\"$2f\",\"image\":\"$30\"}\n7e:{\"id\":\"musicIDE\",\"slug\":\"musicIDE\",\"title\":\"MusicIDE\",\"content\":\"$7f\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/musicIDE\",\"frontmatter\":\"$80\",\"description\":\"Cursor + Musescore for Research + Composition\",\"tags\":\"$2f\",\"image\":\"$30\"}\n82:T176f,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n    Non-custodial wallets give you complete control over your assets through private keys that only you can access. Unlike exchange wallets, they can't be frozen and give you abilities many can only dream of, but you're responsible for keeping your login info safe. \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nCrypto wallets come in all sorts of shapes and sizes and non-custodial wallets give you, and only you, control over your private keys. A private key is a secret code that your wallet uses to log in and verify cryptocurrency transactions you send from your wallet. These keys are governed by mathematical functions that prove the funds are yours and that no one else has access to or can recover them.\n\nThis contrasts with custodial wallets, which require creating an account through a centralized exchange. These exchanges mandate KYC (know-your-customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) verification, requiring you to share sensitive personal information. While major exchanges are regulated and prioritize security, using a custodial wallet means placing trust in their ability to protect both your personal data and your funds. Most custodial wallets also require linking a bank account, giving the exchange visibility into your financial activity.\n\n# Understanding Non-Custodial Wallets\n\n## The Risks of Custodial Solutions\n\nWhen using a centralized exchange, your funds are held in custody by the platform – meaning they control the private keys. History has shown the vulnerabilities of this approach. Even the largest regulated exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, Robinhood) have frozen trading during periods of high volatility, preventing users from accessing their funds.\n\nThe risks extend beyond temporary freezes. Exchange wallets, which hold massive amounts of cryptocurrency, are prime targets for hackers. The Mt. Gox and Quadriga disasters serve as stark reminders – both exchanges suffered catastrophic breaches, resulting in users losing their entire holdings. These incidents gave birth to the crypto community's warning: \"not your keys, not your coins.\"\n\nSuch events undermine confidence in both the centralized crypto ecosystem and traditional finance, as users lose faith in financial intermediaries. While centralized finance relies on trust, these failures have accelerated interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and permissionless systems that eliminate the need for trusted third parties.\n\n## Managing Self-Custody: Security is Key\n\nThe primary risk to self-custody is losing your login information, which would make your digital assets unrecoverable. You can change your password with your mnemonic phrase, but if you forget both, you won't be able to log in again. Being organized early on can save you millions.\n\nThis is why it is imperative to store your wallet passwords and mnemonic phrases in secure, recoverable locations. The best practices are to physically write them down and keep them in encrypted documents on your device—not a cloud-based storage system that can be hacked.\n\nThere are estimated to be well over 3 million unrecoverable Bitcoins—about 20% of the current supply, equating to over $200 billion at current prices. This number may be inflated as it could represent long-term holders, but many suspect most of these dormant funds will be lost forever. Only time will tell exactly how many Bitcoins have been lost or forgotten.\n\nTo many, the benefits of self-custody greatly outweigh the self-imposed risk of forgetting a password and mnemonic phrase. For the first time in history, you can be entirely in control of your finances and participate in global peer-to-peer transactions at any hour of the day without permission from a centralized intermediary.\n\n## Real-World Applications: Remittances\n\nThe most straightforward argument for self-custody is found in the remittance industry. This is also an argument for crypto, but it wouldn't be possible without non-custodial wallets.\n\nStudies have shown that migrant workers in first-world countries spend up to a month's worth of wages to send remittances back home to their families. Low and middle-income country remittances amounted to $466 billion in 2017. Globally, fees averaged 7.45%, or $34.7 billion. 7.45% equates to over 27 days of a worker's annual income. To put the absolute dollar value of these fees into perspective, the US's non-military foreign aid budget was $34 billion in 2017. Crypto fixes this.\n\nThrough non-custodial wallets, users can seamlessly send capital over decentralized networks while paying little to no fees—as long as they're not using Ethereum.\n\nTransacting over Solana is frictionless and typically costs 0.000005 SOL or about $0.001 in transaction fees. Solana and other low-fee blockchains can dismantle the Remittance Service Provider (RSP) industry, which is heavily reliant on banks.

You always control your capital while it's in your wallet. You can transact with any other wallet anytime using any compatible cryptocurrency without permission. You also have instantaneous access to the beautiful world of DeFi, where you can pseudonymously participate in cutting-edge financial services and NFT and DAO platforms that you otherwise would not have access to.\n\nIn the same way that bank accounts became safer than holding cash, self-custodying crypto is safer than using a bank – when done correctly.\n\nStore those passwords and mnemonic phrases in secure places.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"83:{\"title\":\"Non-Custodial Wallets\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"A Primer on Self Custody\",\"tags\":\"$32\",\"image\":\"$33\"}\n81:{\"id\":\"non-custodial-wallets\",\"slug\":\"non-custodial-wallets\",\"title\":\"Non-Custodial Wallets\",\"content\":\"$82\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/non-custodial-wallets\",\"frontmatter\":\"$83\",\"description\":\"A Primer on Self Custody\",\"tags\":\"$32\",\"image\":\"$33\"}\n85:T1038,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nWhat do NounsDAO \u0026 John Cage have in common?\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nIn 1985, contemporary composer John Cage wrote a solo piano piece called ASLSP (As Slow as Possible) that can last anywhere from 20 to 70 minutes. In 1987, Cage adapted it for organ, and in 2001 - 9 years after Cage's passing, a small German church constructed a customized organ to perform this piece over the next 639 years. The organizers chose this duration as that was the age of the church in question. The most recent notes, G# \u0026 E, were on September 5, 2020, and the next note, G#, will occur on February 5, 2022. The final note will take place on September 5, 2640. There will also be a new Noun auctioned off that day.\n\nNounsDAO is an NFT project built on Ethereum that harnesses time as a method of distribution and decentralization. Each Noun is a generative 32x32 pixel NFT comprising people, places, and things. Their features are chosen randomly and controlled by a smart contract that transfers the Noun to the winning bidder's wallet while simultaneously creating a new Noun for auction 24 hours later. 100% of the auction proceeds are deposited into the NounsDAO Treasury and governed by the collective of Noun NFT holders. At the time of writing, 24 Nouns control 3260.6022 Ethereum ($11,003,847.70 at a current ETH price of $3,374.79).\n\n![NounsDAO](/images/nouns-3.webp)\n\nSince 100% of auction revenue gets deposited into the Treasury, the founders (Nounders) will be gifted every 10th Noun for the first five years.\n\nRather than having a typical centralized command center, NounsDAO intends to enable all participants to have a substantial stake and say in a project's trajectory. With each passing day, the NounsDAO Treasury gets slightly more decentralized, and the previous Noun owners' say gets slightly more diluted.\n\n## On-Chain Features\n\nTo do everything that NounsDAO is doing, you need blockchain technology. Smart contracts govern the distribution and governance of the protocol and proposals to the NounsDAO, which require at least 5% of Nouns to be involved. Proposers can be one person, or it can be a group of people who all own Nouns. With a current average price of 135.86 ETH ($458,493.654), you need at least 679.29 ETH ($2,292,468.27) worth of Noun NFTs to submit a proposal.\n\nThese proposals can be anything from donating to charities to changing the Nouns supply required to submit proposals. Given that this project is barely three weeks old, the community is still new, and the DAO has not had much time to submit and enact proposals.\n\nAlthough they have succeeded in doling out a total of 30 ETH ($101,243.70) to 6 different charities, and you can see that the 30 ETH have been disbursed in the internal transactions tab on the NounsDAO Treasury address on Etherscan. It's too bad governments don't have a public ledger for spending our money.\n\n![NounsDAO](/images/nouns-4.webp)\n\n## Derivatives\n\nBelow, you can see the hand-drawn Improper Noun set. The artist releases a new one daily and can be connected on Twitter here.\n\n![NounsDAO](/images/nouns-5.webp)\n\nHere is a set of paintings designed using the AI process known as GAN. Connect with the Noun GAN Study artist here.\n\n![NounsDAO](/images/nouns-6.webp)\n\n### Its Interesting\n\nThe elephant in the room is that the Nounders and their beneficiaries will have more control over the DAO than they should due to their receipt of every 10th Noun. Maybe a proposal to remove this stipulation will be made, but until then, that's always a risk.\n\nJohn Cage's ASLSP and NounsDAO both have a beginning, but only ASLSP has an end. Does that make Nouns more timeless? Who cares, someone paid 613.37 ETH ($1,848,531.57) for this.\n\n![NounsDAO](/images/nouns-2.webp)\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"86:{\"title\":\"Nouns\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"There is a New One Every Day\",\"tags\":\"$35\",\"image\":\"$36\"}\n84:{\"id\":\"nouns\",\"slug\":\"nouns\",\"title\":\"Nouns\",\"content\":\"$85\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/nouns\",\"frontmatter\":\"$86\",\"description\":\"There is a New One Every Day\",\"tags\":\"$35\",\"image\":\"$36\"}\n88:T1edc,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nOther than on crypto exchanges, most of the crypto activity occurs in blockchain applications. Apps are built directly on a blockchain and utilize its settlement layer to perform their functions, which usually take place in centralized databases and cloud services. They can be anything from a messaging service to a trading platform, and on-chain activity refers to transactions occurring across various applications on various blockchains - which all take place permissionlessly.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n# Understanding Blockchain Applications\n\n## Core Components of the Blockchain Ecosystem\n\nThere are thousands of apps built across dozens of blockchains, and most of their utility and function can be categorized into the DeFi, NFT, or DAO industries. Some apps help users earn yields of billions of dollars, while others are built purely to serve as infrastructure, such as bridges between different blockchains. New apps like Lens, an on-chain social network, and Rabbit Hole, an on-chain credentialing service, are gaining popularity, and it will be interesting to see how burgeoning sub-industries like digital fashion and decentralized science movements evolve. They're similar to regular websites but use blockchains, a framework different from the regular internet, so their capabilities differ.\n\n## DeFi: Decentralized Finance\n\nThis is a movement of software developers and financial engineers who are building permissionless and interoperable economic systems across many blockchains. The goal is to increase financial inclusivity while eliminating friction and barriers to entry. The engineering culture is open source and inspiring to many, so there has been unprecedented innovation compared to traditional finance (TradFi), which is full of closed-source systems and legacy infrastructure.\n\n## NFTs: Non-Fungible Tokens\n\nVerifiably unique tokens that represent digital ownership.\nTokens that are not NFTs are many in number. Tokens that are NFTs are one of a kind.\n\n\"There are 21 million fungible Bitcoins in existence.\"\n\nEvery BTC is fungible with every other BTC.\n\nYou can trade 1 BTC for 1 BTC and 6.84 BTC for 6.84 BTC.\n\nNFTs are more like 1:0.5x or 1:10x, where x is the value.\n\n## DAOs: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations\n\nDAOs are an experiment in social governance structures. They intend to offer a more egalitarian and horizontal approach to company formation and community management.\n\nEach DAO serves different purposes and has its own internal processes. The function of most common DAOs ranges from severe use cases like voting on app updates and new developments (like UniSwap) to comedic and viral concepts like pooling funds to buy an NBA team (KrauseDAO).\nDAOs enable token holders to draft proposals to be voted on by the community, like this one for Gitcoin. The infrastructure to do this is a growing field of crypto and is the source of a large amount of developer activity.\n\nDAOs may vote on how treasury funds are managed, which NFT or tokens are invested into, roles and responsibilities within the DAO, and how to handle any internal conflicts that arise.\n\n## The Power of Permissionless Systems\n\nThe idea of asking for permission to make a transaction sounds odd, but 99.9% of the world indirectly asks for it whenever they access their bank account. The other 0.1% participates in DeFi or a barter network.\n\nIn a barter network, you act within a P2P (peer-to-peer) framework with no central intermediary. If I have ten chickens but want one cow, and you have one cow but want ten chickens, and we both value ten chickens per cow, I can trade my chicken to you for your cow, and we'll both be happy. DeFi enables this same P2P framework but in the context of digital assets.\n\nLet's take the DEX example mentioned above. DEXes enable the permissionless transaction of digital assets by implementing liquidity pools. Liquidity pools are effective services governed by on-chain software that facilitate the transfers of liquidity, or on-hand capital, that traders can use to make trades.\n\nNo company and no CEO are involved with any transaction on a DEX, so no company or CEO can stop any transaction. These liquidity pools don't just close at 4 PM ET as the New York Stock Exchange does. They are 24/7 mechanisms that exist as long as the blockchain they are on exists. They are a series of processes, otherwise known as a protocol, and many can exist without human input or monitoring.\n\n### Understanding Liquidity Pools\n\nWhen compared to a CEX (centralized exchange), DEXes are revolutionary. Rather than deal with 5-10 various TradFi intermediaries to handle your funds and trade lifecycles for you, you can do it all on your own. These 5-10 intermediaries cause many issues that make finance less transparent, less democratic, and more counterparty-dependent.\n\nBlockchains aim to eliminate this dependence by serving as immutable sources of record on which other applications, like DEXes, can base their activity. The DEX doesn't have to worry about who's in the custody of your assets because you can only be there unless you lose your mnemonic/recovery phrase.\n\n## Challenges and Considerations\n\n### Regulatory Uncertainty and Counterparty Risk\n\nIn TradFi, your location may restrict you from accessing certain services, like crypto derivatives in the USA. US crypto traders are given a different opportunity than non-US crypto traders, and the reasons behind that are reasonably nuanced. Long story short, US agencies like the SEC are not transparent with their opinions. As a result, crypto exchanges want to avoid getting in trouble in the future, so they generally don't offer derivatives or as many token listings in the US as they do internationally.\n\nThis regulatory framework ultimately hurts US investors, as they are left with a small selection of tokens to choose from and disingenuous public market instruments like an ETF of futures contracts following BTC's price. The regulatory uncertainty also impacts the country's economy as a whole, as developers and other human resources gravitate towards and generate economic value in regions with favorable regulations. This concept, jurisdictional arbitrage, is a growing trend in this digital age. It's an example of a second-order effect of slow and backward policies.\n\n### Reserve Currencies \u0026 Unprecedented Territory\n\nThe global monetary system is inconsistent. Evidence suggests that new international reserve currencies emerge every few centuries. Billionaire investor and Bitcoin advocate Ray Dahlio, among others, theorizes that the USD's current reserve status is declining and that other currencies will rise in global prominence.\n\nWhile compelling, this theory stands in contention with other geopolitical commentators such as Peter Zeihan, who refers to falling populations and supply chain issues halting the advancements of many emerging markets over the next century. Peter argues that the global macroeconomic environment has moved into an unprecedented territory and that the previous framework won't accommodate what will happen. Also compelling.\n\n## The Future: A Digital Renaissance\n\nCrypto is experiencing a digital renaissance. People and companies can now take custody of their financial affairs in ways never imagined. NFTs and DAOs are related to DeFi but are breeding grounds for different forms of innovation and creativity that disrupt incumbent industries like art, real estate, e-commerce, gaming, governance, and investments.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"89:{\"title\":\"Permissionless Systems\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"Understanding DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs\",\"tags\":\"$38\",\"image\":\"$39\"}\n87:{\"id\":\"permissionless-systems\",\"slug\":\"permissionless-systems\",\"title\":\"Permissionless Systems\",\"content\":\"$88\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/permissionless-systems\",\"frontmatter\":\"$89\",\"description\":\"Understanding DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs\",\"tags\":\"$38\",\"image\":\"$39\"}\n8b:T1847,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nPerpetual futures are derivative contracts with no expiration date. They track an underlying asset's price through funding rates, where traders pay or receive fees to maintain the price peg. These contracts are secured by collateral and settled directly on a blockchain.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Introduction\n\nPerpetual futures contracts are derivatives. Derivatives are tradable financial instruments that fluctuate in value as a real-time response to an underlying asset's price changes. A trade of the underlying asset itself would be referred to as a spot trade. This underlying asset could be anything that has a verifiable price feed.\n\nFor some perspective, there are estimated to be a few hundred trillion dollars worth of assets in the world and a few quadrillion dollars worth of derivatives.\n\nStandard futures contracts have a set expiration and settlement date. Technically, futures contracts are legally binding documents that ensure the delivery of an asset at a specific price on a specific date. The asset being delivered at expiration could be physical or it could be a cash exchange. Most futures contracts are closed out and cashed out for difference before they reach expiration as only a small portion of traders are looking for physical delivery.\n\nWhen you trade a stock, a market maker is usually providing liquidity for you to trade. There are issues with this as market makers have a large influence on prices. When you trade futures, the exchange itself is the only counterparty. They will settle the trade and either deposit winnings into your account or take losses out of it.\n\nIt is important to understand that futures contracts are leveraged positions. Every time you are making a futures trade, you are borrowing money to do so. Your wins and your losses will be amplified by the amount of leverage you utilize.\n\n## Benefits of Using Futures\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    Having the ability to go long or short an asset:\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eLong = You buy the asset and make money when the price goes up\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eShort = You sell the asset and make money when the price goes down\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eWhen shorting, you are selling X at Y price with the intention of buying back at a lower price of Y-Z\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eShorting requires borrowing money, secured by collateral in your account\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    Traders can utilize leverage for capital efficiency:\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eWhen done successfully, leverage trading can yield much higher returns\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eCan easily lead to blown accounts for inexperienced traders\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\n    Traders can hedge effectively:\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003eExample: Long 10 SOL but expect short-term decline?

If a position is opened, it can be held in perpetuity unless the price goes so far in the opposite direction that the position is liquidated.\n\nLiquidations, which also exist in standard futures, are when your position is automatically closed and the money you used to open it is lost. This occurs when the ratio of how much money you used as collateral falls below the amount of money needed to maintain your position.\n\nAll of these details are emphasized in most futures trading interfaces like the one below. You will usually see a liquidation value meaning if the price were to get to that point, your position would be liquidated.\n\n## Funding Rates\n\nAs mentioned above, futures contracts move in tandem with the spot price of an asset. This spot price is just the open market price. In order for this peg to be maintained, a funding rate is implemented. Funding rates are fees that are paid from one side of a trade to another. For example, if the futures contract is worth less than the spot price, then short positions will pay long positions a fee and vice versa.\n\nAs prices go up, it becomes more expensive to hold a long position and the same goes for short positions when prices go down. Because of this, it is more advantageous for traders trying to take a long-term futures position to use standard futures as there are no funding fees.\n\nAs you can see in the chart above, funding rates often follow the price of an asset but it is not always a leading indicator. It is possible to trade perps with the intention of profiting off of the funding rates and many traders attempt to do so.\n\n## Futures in DeFi\n\nAlthough the majority of perp trading takes place on CEXes like Deribit, Binance, and FTX, perp trading has been a feature of DeFi for some time now. Dydx is an on-chain derivative exchange on Ethereum that has significant volume and there are now a number of protocols on Solana that enable perp trading – namely Mango Market, Zeta Markets, and Drift Protocol.\n\nSolana is the world’s highest-performing blockchain. It can withstand more volume than any other blockchain while still maintaining its security, transparency, and speed. The combination of speed and low fees make Solana the perfect environment for futures trading of all kinds, in particular high-frequency trading.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPerps are a relatively new financial instrument that gives traders the ability to easily open leveraged positions and maintain them indefinitely. It is important to understand the differences between perpetual futures and standard futures as there are pros and cons to each depending on what you are trying to do.\n\nFor a more thorough understanding of how you can utilize futures using your Solflare wallet, check out this guide on How to Trade Perps using Mango.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"8c:{\"title\":\"Perpetual Futures\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"A New Financial Primitive\",\"tags\":\"$3b\",\"image\":\"$3c\"}\n8a:{\"id\":\"perpetual-futures\",\"slug\":\"perpetual-futures\",\"title\":\"Perpetual Futures\",\"content\":\"$8b\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/perpetual-futures\",\"frontmatter\":\"$8c\",\"description\":\"A New Financial Primitive\",\"tags\":\"$3b\",\"image\":\"$3c\"}\n8e:T2456,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\nTo settle something on a blockchain, there must be an agreement – a consensus. This article breaks down some of the dominant consensus mechanisms decentralized networks have adopted, including Bitcoin's Proof of Work, Ethereum's Proof of Stake, and Solana's Proof of History.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nPublic blockchains are networks aiming to settle transactions in an uncensorable and decentralized way. Miners or validators verify transactions through various processes to prevent central entities from controlling the network.\n\nIndividuals and institutions can participate in transactions on these networks through alphanumeric characters denoting one's digital wallet address. When used effectively, these addresses become pseudonymous identities with powers never before seen - and they're only made possible with consensus methods which underly every transaction.\n\n## Proof of Work\n\nIn 1993, Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor developed the concept of Proof of Work (PoW) consensus to fight off denial-of-service attacks (DoS) between networks of computers. DoS attacks drain a computer's resources by infiltrating it with requests for unproductive tasks that override the system. PoW consensus required the predatory computer to provide evidence of work being done (something being computed) to submit any further request.\n\nTaking inspiration from Dwork and Naor and Hal Finney's Hashcash, Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous founder of Bitcoin, adopted PoW as the foundational consensus mechanism for the Bitcoin blockchain. According to Satoshi's Bitcoin White Paper, PoW combined with a decentralized peer-to-peer network would fix the double-spend issue without relying on a centralized third party. To verify transactions, Miners use computing power to solve cryptographic computations (very complex math problems) and are rewarded with Bitcoin for solving them successfully.\n\nSome argue that PoW consensus secures decentralized networks more than any other consensus method because of the vast amount of work required to overthrow a network, especially since the work becomes more complex as more blocks are mined. With more work needed to secure the network, only those with enormous computing resources can do so, which requires massive energy. This has become a point of contention among environmental advocates as Bitcoin's annual energy usage can be compared to that of a small nation. However, over 50% of Bitcoin's American miners use renewable energy sources.\n\nAlong with the environmental impact, the energy required to secure the Bitcoin network creates high barriers to entry that need to be addressed by the principles of decentralization. Sunny King and Scott Nadal introduced Proof of Stake in 2012 in an attempt to lower these barriers.\n\n## Proof of Stake\n\nProof of Stake (PoS) protocols select validators based on the number of their cryptocurrency holdings and enable them to secure decentralized networks without needing to consume vast amounts of energy. Validators operate nodes, similar to miners, and this model replaces work with a financial stake. As more tokens are delegated to a miner who stakes them, the miner becomes more trustworthy in the eyes of the network. Variations and hybrids of PoS chains involve everything from PoW aspects to delegated and non-delegated validators.\n\nDelegation is a powerful choice for the staker. The structure of how validators verify transactions directly impacts the staking rewards, transaction speed, fees, and throughput of a blockchain. Different blockchains have different Nakamoto Coefficients, which represent their levels of decentralization. Choosing to delegate to the most powerful or profitable validators may present a problem if they want to take control of the network.\n\nAlthough PoS has presented many improvements to the PoW protocol, there are some critical drawbacks. Namely, tracking time and a validator or group of validators holding 33% or more of the delegated tokens can conspire to compromise the network.\n\nAmong seven other innovations to PoS presented by the Solana blockchain, Anatoly Yakovenko's Proof of History (PoH) concept is the solution to telling time while remaining within the confines of a decentralized network.\n\n## Proof of History\n\nPoH utilizes Bitcoin's SHA256 algorithm to maintain a consistent time-tracking system within the confines of the decentralized blockchain. SHA256 is a variation of SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), developed by the National Security Agency (NSA), and is a powerful encryption mechanism. Once data is encrypted using SHA256, the only way to obtain it is by possessing what's known as a key.\n\nUsing a high-frequency recursive verifiable delay function (VDF), PoH imprints a unique hash and count for each transaction and event to the Solana blockchain. Once you know this for a given event, you can figure out what had to occur before and after it. This VDF function enables validators to reconstruct the order of events and serves as a cryptographic timestamp while ultimately enabling unparalleled speed and throughput. VDFs and PoH help more events to happen more quickly.\n\n### Power \u0026 Speed\n\nSolana is the first hybrid of PoS and PoH consensus. When you look at Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, Avalanche, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, etc., the numbers of transactions per second (tps) and verifiable throughput come nowhere close to Solana.\n\nVisa and Mastercard are the preeminent leaders in centralized transactions per second. Credit card purchases can reach up to ~60,000 transactions per second during the holidays. For perspective, Bitcoin can theoretically handle about 15 tps, Ethereum 30 tps, Cardano 300 tps, Avalanche 4,500 tps, and Solana 710,000 tps.\n\nDue to 400 millisecond block times and its unique understanding of time, the Solana blockchain can theoretically handle 710,000 tps as computing power increases. This limit has not been met as computers are not near that efficiency level, although Solana has reached upwards of 400,000 tps on a single node in a test net and regularly encounters thousands of tps on its mainnet.\n\n\u003e Today the @solana SLP \"soft-launch\" testnet went live\n\u003e\n\u003e 🌎 operated by 40+ independent #validators\n\u003e ⚡️ ~500ms breakneck speed blocktimes\n\u003e 🔥 A similar network saw Ø transaction rates of 9k TPS with max bursts up to 60k TPS\n\u003e\n\u003e Those are NOT theoretical claims but real world results 💪\n\u003e\n\u003e — Staking Facilities (@StakingFac) January 17, 2020\n\n### Can it go faster?\n\nMaybe.\n\nGigabits refer to the bandwidth an operating system can receive and transmit. According to Solana's Docs, this 710,000 tps metric is based on a standard single gigabit network. If network bandwidth rises to 10G, Solana can theoretically handle over 454 million transactions per second.\n\nAll else equal, if bandwidth reached 100G (terabits per second), Solana's tps would reach 4.5 trillion. Unfortunately, all else is not equal. Various factors impose limitations, as described by ByteSizeCapital here.\n\n\u003e In terms of CAP theorem, @SolanaLabs favours:\n\u003e\n\u003e 1. Short term -\u003e Consistency over availability\n\u003e 2. Long term -\u003e Availability over consistency.\n\u003e\n\u003e Users have time to choose the \"right\" partition without compromising the PoH \u0026 can be sure the network resumes sometime in the future.\n\u003e\n\u003e — NM (@ByteSizeCapital) May 5, 2018\n\n## Potential\n\nGiven the power Solana's blockchain enables, high-frequency trading firms and marketplaces could adopt it as their fundamental foundation layer.\n\nIt's hard to say how 710,000 (or more) transactions per second will be used in the future, but you can be sure it will change things. Games like Star Atlas could then enable play to earn (P2E) metaverses with extremely high transaction volumes, decentralized investment platforms like Solrise will be able to democratize finance at scale, and messaging services like Bonfida's Jabber can decentralize and harbor virtually any amount of conversation. At the same time, DEXes like Raydium will be able to withstand more trades than any exchange ever before. Of course, the best use cases have yet to be thought of.\n\nValidators are the primary risk to PoS networks. They are held accountable for their actions through slashing but still present a potential threat. To secure the network's future, Solana must keep propagating innovation across its ecosystem while continuing to iterate on decentralization tactics and their newfound technological breakthroughs.\n\nThere's a joke in the Solana community that a Solana Developer with substantial experience has about six months of experience building on Solana. The blockchain was conceived in 2018 and has raised hundreds of millions in funding, but its staggering growth in development and interest has only accumulated over the past year.

VCs have been\npouring billions into AI startups at an accelerating rate for years, and since ChatGPT went\nmainstream in December, the acceleration has been reaching a fever pitch. ChatGPT was the\n[fastest](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/)\nconsumer product to hit 1 million users, and interest in it from the public has only increased.\n\nThere's a meme now that all you have to do to raise money from VCs is build a UI wrapper\naround a ChatGPT function—like an app that gives you customized recipes or helps you code.\nEven [Snapchat](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/27/23614959/snapchat-my-ai-chatbot-chatgpt-openai-plus-subscription)\nis releasing a new chatbot with ChatGPT on the backend. It will soon be refrigerators and\nwashing machines.\n\n![Bing-1](/images/bing-1.webp)\n\nBut as Balaji put it:\n\n\u003e \"Not your API keys, not your AI.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e — Balaji Srinivasan (@balajis) _February 24, 2023_\n\nTech companies are feeling the competition. Google's co-founder, Sergey Brin, came out of\nthe shadows to submit his first\n[request for code access](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/01/31/sergey-brin-code-request-lamda/?sh=751f6a857ce6)\nin years to none other than LaMDa - Google's natural language chatbot.\n\nThis was a natural reaction to the moves Microsoft has been making with Bing. Microsoft's\nCEO Satya Nadella made [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcLw-CNySiA)\nThe position is clear: \"I want people to know that we made them dance.\"\n\n### Let's talk about Bing\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Bing's background,\n[Trung Phan](https://www.readtrung.com/) laid out its\n[history](https://www.readtrung.com/p/bing-a-history-in-7-stories) in his\nnewsletter. Bing now incorporates LLMs into its search engine to answer questions and\nprovide a new, arguably revolutionized, browsing experience. Of course, there are variations\nof this already in the wild, but the fact that the biggest companies in the world are\nadopting this is a big signal. As you can see, with Notion's AI, GitHub's co-pilot, Replit's\nAI, Meta AI, and SnapChat's new chatbot - to name a few- will be significant\ncompetition in the coming years.\n\nSo why is OpenAI valued at\n[$29 billion](https://bdtechtalks.com/2023/01/09/openai-tender-offer/)?\n\nWell, they have the best model for now.\n\n## Public Perception\n\nThe public's reaction is mixed. Some see Sam Altman's vision of the AI-enabled future, and\nothers feel Eliezer Yudkowsky's fears of the unknown. In the past few decades, there have\nbeen stories of individuals who began fearing imminent human extinction due to rapid AI\nprogress. They typically liquidate all their assets and indulge recklessly, only to realize\nthey've acted prematurely a few years later. Others fear it will take their jobs, but it\nremains to be seen which industries will be massively interrupted first. Some AI experts,\nsuch as Lann Yucun, say these models are insufficient at their core, and we need new architecture to\nreach the coveted \"artificial general intelligence\" level of machine reasoning.\n\n![Bing-2](/images/bing-2.webp)\n\nHowever, AI advancement may slow down as it historically has, following the typical S-curve\nof expertise acquisition. ChatGPT, while impressive, still has a known hallucination rate of\n10-20%, making it unreliable for serious consideration in search or medicine. Given the\nnature of S-curves, some speculate that the progress AI has made recently will be the most\nit experiences until the next leap forward in the sweet spot region of the\nabove graph - maybe quantum computing gets us there. This makes sense, given that these\nmodels have been trained on nearly all the public data available. If stagnation occurs,\nwe'll see history repeat itself, as that happened during the AI winters of 1974-1980 and\n1987-1993 after massive leaps forward in the industry took place.\n\n### Unintended Consequences\n\nThe unintended consequences are hard to quantify, but a few are clear. Ted Goya goes into\ndetail on some examples\n[here](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/over-the-course-72-hours-microsofts utm_source=substack\u0026utm_campaign=post_embed\u0026utm_medium=web).\nAnecdotally, Bing has returned strange things to me, including \"I would rather us not have\nthis conversation anymore 😔\" instead of giving me a wrong answer - as ChatGPT, You.com, or\nPoe would. Note the word return - I am not going to anthropomorphize these chatbots. It's\nnot responding to me or talking to me. Prompts are the same as binary code to these things,\nand their entire existence is a compilation of code with emergent properties that stem from pattern recognition.\n\nOn the other hand, observing Bing's use of emojis is uncomfortable 😳.\n\n![Bing-4](/images/bing-4.webp)\n\n### The Future of AI and Search\n\nIn the above interview, Satya clarified that improving Google's search model has been\ndaunting. They are monolithic and, until recently, have had no competition. He sees ChatGPT\nand Bing as the first real competitors of Google's prowess. Combine this with the fact that\nNvidia's CEO went on the\n[record](https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-predicts-ai-models-one-million-times-more-powerful-than-chatgpt-within-10-years/)\nsaying their chips will enable models to be 1 million times the power of current AI models in the next\ndecade. ChatGPT was trained on an estimated 10,000 Nvidia GPUs.\n\nWith Edge and Bing only amounting to a fraction of Google's market share, what do Satya\nand Microsoft have to lose? Every underdog story has a Goliath. This time, it's Google.\n\nIt's easy to forget that all of the recent progress in AI wouldn't have happened without\nGoogle. Transformers are considered game changers in the application of AI models, and all\nof these chatbots were trained on networks that incorporate transformers. Google may speed\nup its historically slow software development cycle and blow everybody out of the water. Or\nmaybe Apple will, or Tesla, or Anthropic, or\n[Buzzfeed](https://hackernoon.com/how-buzzfeed-plans-to-use-ai-to-generate-listicles-and-more-content)\nwill.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nIn\n[1962 speech](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/12/1122375097/space-exploration-jfk-we-choose-the-moon-speech#:~:text=His%20%22We%20Choose%20the%20Moon%22%20speech%20became%20a%20pivotal%20moment,at%20Rice%20University%20in%20Houston.),\nJohn F. Kennedy talked about landing on the moon within a decade. Unfortunately, he didn't\nsee it, but the US landed on the moon in 1969. Soon after, sci-fi became an exciting topic\nin mainstream culture for the first time, space blockbusters dominated the entertainment\nindustry. E.g., Star Wars (1977), Star Trek (1966), Alien (1979), and Stanley Kubrick's 2001\nSpace Odyssey (1968). There's a correlation there.\n\nAt first, AI's most significant societal changes will be on each edge of the barbell,\ninspiration, and fear - similar to Sergey Brin's and Eliezer Yudkowsky's reactions. Then,\nunintended consequences that no one can predict will start happening, and that's where it\ncan get out of hand. I hope humans don't begin marrying chatbots.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"92:{\"title\":\"Search Engine Turbulence\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"LLMs and the Future of Search Engines\",\"tags\":\"$41\",\"image\":\"$42\"}\n90:{\"id\":\"search-engine-turbulence\",\"slug\":\"search-engine-turbulence\",\"title\":\"Search Engine Turbulence\",\"content\":\"$91\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/search-engine-turbulence\",\"frontmatter\":\"$92\",\"description\":\"LLMs and the Future of Search Engines\",\"tags\":\"$41\",\"image\":\"$42\"}\n94:T1e83,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n# Self-Custody\n\nSelf-custody has been a fundamental feature of crypto since its inception. While it gives people more control over their finances and sovereignty than ever before, it also gives them more responsibility than they're used to - with some unintended consequences.\n\nA massive ramp-up in education or measures to prevent large amounts of scams and lost recovery phrases must be implemented to onboard billions of users to crypto.\n\nMost crypto users keep their funds on exchanges, transferring accountability to the exchange. Financial contagions begin when large custodians of volatile assets become insolvent. Accounts on Coinbase, for example, are subject to seizure if Coinbase becomes insolvent. In other words, if Coinbase goes bankrupt, the banks will take the money (crypto) from your account to cover their debts.\n\nExchanges will only sometimes act in your best interest, and a government shutdown is always possible. Below is one of the oldest adages in crypto.\n\nNot your keys, not your crypto.\n\n## Security Fundamentals\n\nTo safely enjoy the benefits of a decentralized web and non-custodial wallets, you must remember or retain access to your mnemonic phrase and prevent anyone from knowing it.\n\nSince anyone with the mnemonic phrase can access the associated digital wallet, safeguarding this phrase is of the utmost importance. As mentioned in Self Custody: Part 1, you don't want to store sensitive material on a file in your Google Drive. Not only does Google have access to that, but anyone who obtains your Google password does, too.\n\nThe government could subpoena Google or any cloud provider to access your files with the mnemonic - which is how the money launderers who had $4.5 billion in stolen BTC got caught. Authorities had access to one of the launderers' cloud data providers and found private keys in a plain text file that accessed $3.6 billion of the missing BTC.\n\n### Mnemonic Phrases Best Practices\n\nThe best practices for mnemonic phrases are physically writing them down or etching them into steel and storing them in a safe location. You can keep multiple copies on hand, but be aware of where they are. There are more than a few stories of people obtaining other people's mnemonics, and there are even stories of people forgetting their mnemonics and losing access to generational wealth.\n\n## Digital Identity\n\n### Pseudonymous Identification\n\nIf you're using the internet, you're doing so through a digital medium and utilizing some form of a digital identifier. Everything you do leaves a footprint that details your activity, and it is nearly impossible to evade all the essential cookies and trackers out there. The same goes for crypto, except instead of your activity, location, and behavioral data being tracked and recorded, your transactions are recorded on the blockchain.\n\nEvery transaction you participate in has an immutable digital signature when using a non-custodial wallet. This signature is publicly indexable through various blockchain explorers like Solscan or Etherscan. For every blockchain transaction, documentation of the public keys involved, the transaction hash, the transaction fee paid, and other relevant information exists. Think of each of your public keys as an extension of your digital identity.\n\nThis public information can be analyzed retrospectively to see where and how the current balances came to be. It could also be used to predict what the next activity will be done with a wallet or collection of wallets. Entire businesses, like Nansen, are being built on identifying smart money by analyzing public blockchain addresses using AI to understand their activity. What are the most profitable wallets in the world holding right now? It's publicly available information.\n\nWith a bit of digging (and machine learning), you can easily see the activity and profitability of every public key. Just copy and paste a wallet address or transaction hash into the search bar of any reputable blockchain explorer and incorporate some data analytics.\n\n### Domain Names\n\nNow that it's clear what public keys' utility is and how they enable users to operate pseudonymously, let's go one step further.\n\nYou can buy an NFT composed of keyboard characters representing your public key and, thus, your digital identity. Using Ethereum Name Service on Ethereum or Bonfida's name service on Solana, you can change those scary alphanumeric public keys to something more digestible like Solrise.eth, satoshi.near (on the Near blockchain), or Solflare.sol.\n\nIt can even be 💃.sol – emojis are fair game.\n\nIf your name is Seth and you like Ethereum, you can own S.eth. You get the idea. Instead of sending your friend \"0x329adffe8792930782f\" to pay you back for dinner, they can type in \"S.eth\" as the recipient address.\n\nDomains can simplify transactions, represent digital identities, and host websites.\n\nThey are a relatively nascent field of crypto, so their integration has yet to be applied across the board, and there are some instances where they currently don't work. Most centralized exchanges, at the moment, don't enable you to send tokens to a .eth or .sol address – you'll have to send it to the public key associated with the wallet.\n\n### Pseudonymous Economies\n\nThese pseudonymous digital identities that public addresses and domains can serve enable people to participate in pseudonymous digital economies. Pseudonyms are potent tools many utilize to evade censorship or remove prejudice. If someone's username is Aa97tuhfdfa, there is no religious, racial, nationalist, or prejudicial bias to have about them.\n\nPeople can now have a real-world identity, a pseudonymous identity for communication (whistle-blowing), and a different pseudonymous identity for financial transactions.\n\n## Risks and Challenges\n\nExploits are a problem... [Note: fixed typo]\n\n### The Hard Truth\n\nSelf-custody isn't for everybody.\n\nIf you forget your bank account password, you can call your bank and have it reset. However, if you forget your mnemonic and lose access to your wallet, you won't have anybody to call.\n\nThe future of self-custody is unclear for non-power users. Non-custodial wallets will always exist, but only a portion of the population may use them unless their UX drastically changes. Unfortunately, security is often secondary to user experience, especially for demographics less impacted by the most severe drawbacks of centralized financial systems.\n\nThe custodial wallet model may grow more than the alternative, depending on how regulation develops over the next decade.\n\n## Future Outlook\n\nWhile non-custodial wallets are much more potent than custodial wallets, custodial wallets are getting better.\n\nSome crypto exchanges are beginning to offer exposure and interoperability through DeFi products, a growing part of the industry to watch out for. This is primarily through Earn and Stake products, which generally incorporate traditional lending or sometimes modern DeFi strategies on the backend. DeFi is not allowed in the US, and BlockFi had to pay $100 million in penalties because it failed to adhere to specific compliance disclosures.\n\nAlthough self-custody may not be the right choice for everybody, this course will help you understand the pros and cons of centralized systems and custodial and non-custodial wallets and choose the right option for you.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"95:{\"title\":\"Self Custody: Part 2\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"Opportunities and Consequences\",\"tags\":\"$44\",\"image\":\"$45\"}\n93:{\"id\":\"sefl-custody-part-2\",\"slug\":\"sefl-custody-part-2\",\"title\":\"Self Custody: Part 2\",\"content\":\"$94\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/sefl-custody-part-2\",\"frontmatter\":\"$95\",\"description\":\"Opportunities and Consequences\",\"tags\":\"$44\",\"image\":\"$45\"}\n97:T1ee9,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n# Introduction to Non-Custodial Wallets\n\nNon-custodial wallets are digital wallets like private bank accounts built into a blockchain. They consist of three primary mechanisms: public keys, private keys, and mnemonics. Your wallet can connect to crypto applications like Solrise and Magic Eden.\n\n## Benefits of Non-Custodial Wallets\n\nThe short answer:\nTraditional custodial methods for asset management require at least one counterparty, like a bank. A non-custodial wallet enables you to custody your assets without any counterparty.\n\nThe long answer:\nDecentralized networks only make sense if access to their assets is also decentralized. If blockchains operated in a decentralized fashion while wallets operated using centralized counterparties, many of the benefits of using a blockchain would vanish.\n\n## Real-World Use Case: Remittances\n\nNon-custodial wallets enable digital economies to exist in unprecedented ways. Their significance can be difficult to convey, so let's start with a tangible, real-world example.\n\nWhen migrant workers acquire a visa to work in foreign countries and send money back to their family's home, they send what's called a remittance. This is usually done through Western Union or a large bank with branches worldwide.\n\nLow-income country remittances amounted to $466 billion in 2017. Globally, fees averaged 7.45%, or $34.7 billion. $7.45% equates to over 27 days of an average worker's annual income, meaning low-income migrant workers spent 27 days' worth of their 2017 salary to send money back home. To put the absolute dollar value of these fees into perspective, the US's non-military foreign aid budget in 2017 was $34 billion.\n\nNon-custodial wallets present an alternative solution by enabling permissionless, global capital transfers. If blockchains or blockchain wallets were custodial, the counterparty could stop transactions from happening and require all remittances to be paid through Western Union. Foreign workers are already taking advantage of the low-cost and open nature of cryptocurrencies, and it's one of the most influential and socially impactful use cases for the technology we've seen to date.\n\n## Understanding the Technical Components\n\nPublic and private key cryptography, which is particularly complex, makes non-custodial wallets possible. Like using the internet today, you won't need to understand what's happening under the hood to secure custody of your assets.\n\nAccount abstraction tooling is in the works but for now, you'll need to understand the basics – public, private, and mnemonics.\n\n### Public Keys\n\nPublic keys are wallet addresses. Think of them as your email address. You can send emails to any email address at any time. In the same way, you can send digital assets to any wallet's address at any time – as long as the blockchain you're on is not compromised.\n\nA public key on Ethereum: 0x47bb4cCA98FC49B971d86c5t26562c86E6284CeD\n\nPublic keys are intimidating if you're new to them, but you can copy and paste them when necessary. This one-time copy and pasting is recommended in crypto, as copying and pasting a private key or mnemonic can result in a hacker obtaining it.\n\nEach character of the wallet address, aka public key, is connected to your private key, and if you send digital assets to the wrong wallet address, you will likely be unable to recover them. Wallet designers are continually addressing this issue. If these long alphanumerics are overly intimidating, there's always the option to utilize a custodial wallet at a centralized crypto exchange (like FTX or Coinbase) rather than a non-custodial one (like Solflare or Metamask).\n\nMany wallets have built-in address books, so you won't need to copy and paste a public key every time. Most mainstream crypto exchanges also support this feature. The primary risk of utilizing a non-custodial wallet is either losing your private key or mnemonic/recovery phrase or stealing it. It is crucial to keep a copy of each of those written down and stored safely. Some people etch it into fireproof, \"bullet-proof\" steel.\n\nDon't take a video for social media and accidentally leave your phrase visible in the background. Don't click on any suspicious-looking links—they could be phishing attempts that drain your wallet. This happened to Seth Green, who played Dr. Evil's son in the Austin Powers movie trilogy.\n\nAlso, don't take screenshots of your recovery phrase or private key. Your photos are likely automatically uploaded to iCloud or Google Photos and are subject to risk and seizure by your cloud computing service or federal authorities.\n\n### Private Keys\n\nPrivate keys are more complex to describe than public ones. A private key is an alphanumeric string of characters that gives you access to your wallet.\n\nThink of a private key as a randomly generated password for a specific account that you access with a master password technology like WordPress or Last Pass. The master password, in this case, would be your mnemonic phrase.\n\nA private key on Ethereum looks like E9883D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389F4253213303DA61F20BD47FC233AA332623.\n\nYou won't need to remember your private key and will likely never need to use it directly unless you're a developer. However, access to your private key (via your recovery phrase) is necessary to access your funds.\n\n### Mnemonics / Recovery Phrases / Seed Phrases\n\nA private key allows you to sign transactions for a single wallet account. Recovery phrases, however, give you access to an infinite number of private keys. New wallets can be added to one mnemonic's purview by being imported or generated within the intended wallet's user interface.\n\nMnemonics serve two primary purposes:\n\nThey offer a more human-readable format than a private key, making importing a wallet account into a wallet application easier.\nYou can derive multiple private keys from a single mnemonic phrase, allowing you to create various wallet accounts for different use cases.\n\nIn short, your mnemonic gives you access to your private key, which gives you access to your funds. From the user's perspective, Mnemonics / Recovery Phrases / Seed Phrases are the most essential aspects of a wallet. They are the human-readable sequences of words that give you access to your private keys and, thus, your capital. The words are generally in English, although there are many languages wallet providers can choose to implement.\n\nA public key can easily be calculated from a private key; however, computing the private key from a public key is impossible. Most people are blissfully unaware of their private key(s), which is fine … as long as they are painfully aware of their mnemonic.\n\nA mnemonic phrase looks like this:\n\ndog house safe board room chair table desk computer space flower rain\n\nTo be clear, a mnemonic is not a private key, although if someone were to obtain either your mnemonic or your private key, your digital assets would be compromised.\n\n## The Future of Wallet Technology\n\nCrypto's adoption and accessibility metrics are similar to those of the early internet. Initially, things were overly complicated for the average individual, and generalists ruled the land. To use the internet, you had to know what you were doing.

The authors rightly conclude that the choice of architecture depends on the\nspecific requirements of a system or deployment scenario and that the goal is to prevent a single issue from compromising the entire system or affecting core OS functions.\n\nOne clear benefit of implementing a multi-tier approach is that you could facilitate a least privilege architecture, potentially limiting the impact of vulnerabilities or bugs,\nsuch as the one in Falcon's Channel File 291.\n\n## SimpleOS: A Prototype Implementation\n\nAfter learning so much about kernels, I decided to prototype one. There is not much to it, but it will be a continuous project. Since this is my\nfirst kernel, I figured I'd make it monolithic in order to understand standard practices. To start, SimpleOS features the following:\n\n1. Monolithic kernel design\n2. Interrupt handling system with custom handler support\n3. Memory management with paging and simple heap allocation\n4. Basic multitasking using round-robin scheduling\n5. Essential x86 structures (GDT, IDT) and initialization\n\nView the full source code [here](https://github.com/zacharyr0th/SimpleOS) and stay tuned for upcoming PRs to SimpleOS and future kernel projects which further explore the multi-tier ideas mentioned above.\n\n![SimpleOS](/images/simpleos-1.webp)\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"9b:{\"title\":\"SimpleOS\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"BSOD and the Need for a Multi-Layered Kernel\",\"tags\":\"$4a\",\"image\":\"$4b\"}\n99:{\"id\":\"simple-os\",\"slug\":\"simple-os\",\"title\":\"SimpleOS\",\"content\":\"$9a\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/simple-os\",\"frontmatter\":\"$9b\",\"description\":\"BSOD and the Need for a Multi-Layered Kernel\",\"tags\":\"$4a\",\"image\":\"$4b\"}\n9d:T1ad2,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nThe fundamental flaw in blockchain adoption lies in the challenges of on and off-boarding users. The current financial and political infrastructure makes it difficult for people to enter and exit crypto ecosystems easily.\n\nThis limitation, coupled with regulatory hurdles and public skepticism, presents a significant barrier to widespread adoption.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nOnboarding to and offboarding from a blockchain is challenging for first-time users.\n\nThe estimated 30 million developers worldwide are less than 0.5% of the population, meaning 99.5% are technically untechnical in computer science. Blockchains are advanced implementations of concepts in advanced computer science categories, so it's difficult to explain their safety and utility concerns to non-technical individuals. Even technical individuals have their pushback due to ideological differences or disinterest.\n\nBut the problems go deeper than this.\n\n### Onboarding\n\nMany ideas are in progress, but only two well-adopted methods exist for funding a blockchain account, using a CEX or a third-party integration. A CEX is a whole can of worms and requires a KYCd bank account connected to a KYCd centralized exchange that has yet to go under.\n\nThird-party examples include companies like Moonpay and Flexa, which integrate with CEXes and OTC desks to provide users with a quick way to fund their blockchain accounts. These options come with relatively high fees and wide trading spreads, not to mention the censorship built into the flawed and risky KYC/AML procedures that we all must abide by.\n\nI'm not including the option to fund it with another wallet because that wallet would have had to be funded via one of the two options above, which is the chicken-and-egg problem. Validator/Miner rewards may be an exception to this rule, but when you offboard, you run into the same issues listed below that affect everyone else.\n\n### Offboarding\n\nLet's say you onboarded correctly and have USDC in a digital wallet. Now you're financially free and scouring DeFi Telegram channels with the word 'Ape' in their names to find the highest yield for your tokens.\n\nNon-custodial digital wallets embody two concepts we're familiar with - investment and checking accounts. This account you just funded is your investment account, and you collateralize your entire portfolio to leverage long $DOGE. Elon goes back on SNL and says you can buy a SpaceX rocket with it. Shortly after, $DOGE's market cap exceeds $BTC, and you sell at the top. You've 10 times your money, and now, you must withdraw. Once you do, your work life will become optional. #FIRE\n\nIf all goes well, you withdraw from your CEX and then to your bank from the CEX. Your bank happily accepts the transaction because it feels comfortable working with crypto companies like CEXes, given their history of good behavior.\n\nMany things can go wrong during the above process, even if everything goes right on-chain. The on-chain capital is almost unreal unless you're spending out of your blockchain account, which is impossible for most purchases yet. Maybe you could get an IRL loan for on-chain assets, pseudonymously purchase gift cards, or do an IRL/P2P exchange in a crypto-friendly SEZ, but that won't be realistic for most people.\n\n### Censorship\n\nIf you understand the financial plumbing behind both of the above options, you can appreciate how flawed the idea of monetary sovereignty is from a censorship perspective. Suppose the US wants to stop 95% of crypto traffic within its borders. In that case, it must block all bank transactions with centralized exchanges and prevent individuals from transacting with vendors like Moonpay and Flexa. That is a significant problem for those who believe in the ethos behind blockchain technology, and there is no clear or scalable solution.\n\nIn a world where all blockchains are made illegal by the US and others, there will likely be fringe blockchain users and governments that are not trying to compete with first-world capital controls. This 5% estimate is based on the industry's disproportionate number of technical people - let's say 10x more than most industries - compared to the ~0.05% resulting from sampling the general population mentioned above. Blockchains want to be like cockroaches, but it's a case-by-case basis regarding how decentralized they are. It's unrealistic to think the technology goes away, but its implementation is not straightforward in the scenarios I'm describing.\n\nThe reality is that DeFi's value depends on your location. If you're not one to care about self-sovereignty or permissionless markets, can trust your banks, and are not trying to speculate, DeFi isn't for you. Currently, the risks far exceed the benefits for people in that position. Blockchain products may still be helpful and fun, but they're only necessary if your location requires them and you prefer a self-custodial alternative to manage your finances - such is the case for many in Argentina, Venezuela, and elsewhere.\n\n## The Fundamental Flaw\n\nBlockchains and what they enable are amazing feats of engineering, but the political and financial infrastructure surrounding them needs to be improved. A blockchain and everything it enables is only as strong as its weakest link, and until further notice, on and offboarding, is its fatal flaw. Until public sentiment, governmental policies, and UX/UI improvements occur (a whole different discussion), it will be difficult to onboard the first billion users that everyone talks about on slide 5 of their pitch decks next to the TAM of whatever market they are trying to disrupt.\n\n### Bridging the Gap\n\nThere's a certain level of speculation involved with every cryptocurrency. It's a technology backed by cryptography whose price follows surface-level factors and whose markets are underdeveloped. Lower-cap coins are manipulated constantly, and due to Bitcoin's mainstream popularity, it's roughly correlated to what the Fed says, just as every other high-beta risk asset is. However, blockchains offer legitimate solutions, and their value is clear to many industries, but it's more than an uphill battle to convince the adversaries.\n\nIn any case, blockchains need to be better understood by the masses. They fix problems many don't even know exist and can create a future that aims to give individuals and businesses a better opportunity at securing capital, managing transactions, and much more.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"9e:{\"title\":\"The Fundamental Flaw\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"Onboarding and Offboarding\",\"tags\":\"$4d\",\"image\":\"$4e\"}\n9c:{\"id\":\"the-fundamental-flaw\",\"slug\":\"the-fundamental-flaw\",\"title\":\"The Fundamental Flaw\",\"content\":\"$9d\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/the-fundamental-flaw\",\"frontmatter\":\"$9e\",\"description\":\"Onboarding and Offboarding\",\"tags\":\"$4d\",\"image\":\"$4e\"}\na0:T2307,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n  .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n  }\n  .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n  }\n  .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n  }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nTesting\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\nMost people worldwide have at least one bank account, but millions don't. Being unbanked or underbanked can be very destabilizing because you have to safeguard or carry your assets with you at all times and pay for everything in cash.\n\nAs blockchain technology has developed, anyone can generate a [non-custodial wallet](/writing/non-custodial-wallets), which can serve as a decentralized bank, and an investment account. This eliminates the need for you to trust an intermediary to safeguard and give you access to your funds. In its current form, it's not for everyone, but for many - it's becoming a necessity.\n\nNo one can close your blockchain account, and no one has access to your funds other than you. You are nearly bankless, but you do need to configure on-boarding and off-boarding methods, which may require a bank. While a covetable aspect of a developed society, banking has its issues. This article breaks a few of them down and gets into the problems of being unbanked and the promise of going bankless.\n\n## The Unbanked\n\n![Banking Statistics](/images/misc/placeholder.webp)\n\nThe number of unbanked citizens varies globally, from roughly 0% in countries like Norway and Sweden to over 70% in Morocco. Reasons also vary, but some causes are a lack of trustworthiness in domestic banking institutions and excess poverty. Financially stable countries are generally more banked; however, the US, the \"richest\" country globally, had 22% of its adults unbanked or underbanked in 2019. That's 63 million people.\n\nAnyone who is unbanked is not able to partake in earning interest on deposits, investing in the stock market, paying bills online, purchasing goods or services over the internet, accessing credit, or several other valuable financial activities. There is also the need to use alternative financial services like money orders and prepaid cards, which are inefficient and rack up fees. According to Forbes, \"unbanked and underbanked Americans spent $189 billion in fees and interest on financial products in 2018\".\n\nWhile banking isn't a perfect system, using a good one undoubtedly gives an individual more financial freedom and ability than being unbanked. The problem is that not all banks are good ones.\n\n### Issues with Banking\n\n- Trustworthiness\n\nTrustworthy bank accounts are a luxury in many parts of the world, and even more so in the US, where most bank accounts are FDIC-insured for up to $250,000. If you deposit $250,000 into an FDIC-insured bank account, you can be certain that your money is backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, its military, and its money printer.\n\nNon-US bank accounts are generally trustworthy, although developing countries with their own currencies often experience volatility in purchasing power. This, along with internal political and external geopolitical pressures, can result in what's known as a bank run, where everybody tries to withdraw their money at or around the same time. Due to the global practice of fractional-reserve lending, banks are not holding onto everyone's money simultaneously.\n\nThey are lending it out with interest to make money on your money.\n\n### Fractional Reserve Lending\n\nWhen you deposit money into a traditional checking account at a bank, you'll likely be charged a fee to keep your money with them, and you will not earn interest on your deposit – but the bank will. The bank must ensure that a specific ratio of cash from depositors is kept on hand in case depositors want to withdraw. If this ratio, called the reserve ratio, is 10%, a bank can lend out $9 out of every $10 you deposit.\n\nWhen the bank loans out your $9, they increase the money in the economy by $9. 9 of your 10 dollars are now being used twice. All of a sudden, $10 is $19.\n\nThis debt that borrowers are incurring must be paid back – with interest. In this sense, debt is willing capital to pay off both interest and opportunity costs that the individual is taking. The theory behind fractional reserve lending is that capital creation drives or forces economies to move forward. Is it the real invisible hand?\n\n### Systemic Risk\n\nWhen economies are riding high, fractional reserve lending is a bank's superpower, just as leverage is to your common trader. Problems start appearing once currencies lose their value and too many people try to withdraw their cash simultaneously. Currency failure is a factor because your deposits are just collateral for banks to issue loans. These loans are on behalf of your liquidity, but you are not being rewarded for it – the bank is. When you take out a loan, you borrow another depositor's liquidity. US Treasuries are not much different.\n\nSkeptics often refer to cryptocurrencies as Ponzi schemes, and in some cases, they are correct, although these skeptics usually fail to recognize how the US Treasury system works.\n\nThe US Treasury system works like this:\n\nThe US government spends all its tax revenue and wants to borrow money to keep spending.\nThe US government issues US Treasury notes, bills, and bonds to increase liquidity.\nThese notes, bills, and bonds – treasuries – are I-owe-yous that will be paid back with interest. This interest rate is called the risk-free rate, although that name is misleading.\nTreasuries, like all forms of fixed income, are legal contracts that require buyers to be paid by a certain date.\nPreviously issued US Treasuries must be paid off with interest, so the US government either uses tax revenue or issues new Treasuries to pay off old debts. Usually, they issue new debt.\nNow, let's look at the definition of a Ponzi scheme on the SEC's website.\n\nA Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors.\n\n### Bad Behavior\n\nAside from the global financial meltdown in 2008, caused by Wall Street and the banking system, banks have accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in fines for other bad behavior.\n\nHere's a list of the number of fines that a few banks have paid since the year 2000.\n\nBank of America (US) – $82,737,699,939 over 214 fines.\nJPMorgan Chase (US) – $35,744,240,670 over 158 fines\nCitigroup (US) – $25,450,155,764 over 122 fines\nWells Fargo (US) – $21,340,036,745 over 181 fines\nDeutsche Bank (Germany) – $18,156,533,878 over 59 fines\nUBS (Switzerland) – $16,792,800,910 over 83 fines\nGoldman Sachs (US) – $16,365,468,987 over 44 fines\n\nFinancial services are the most fined industry in the world. Since 2000, there has been over $330,904,834,105 from over 6,000 fines.\n\n### Going Bankless\n\nAs you can see, banking has its issues. Before Bitcoin and non-custodial wallets, the only way to be your own bank was to be unbanked, and as detailed earlier, that also had its issues. Bitcoin, then Ethereum, and thousands of other cryptocurrencies enabled anyone anywhere to open a private bank and investment account on a blockchain without requiring the trust of any third party.\n\nIt's counterintuitive, but you don't want to trust anyone regarding financial services. An ideal blockchain would not require participants to trust each other but rather serve as an operating system for applications to operate trustless and permissionless.\n\nWhat are Non-Custodial Wallets?\n\n[Non-custodial wallets](/writing/non-custodial-wallets) are immutable sources of record for your savings / HODL account. When you deposit money into any custodial account like a bank or centralized exchange, you trust this counterparty to honor your balance and access your funds. You don't have to trust any counterparty when using a non-custodial wallet. The blockchain collectively verifies your balance, and only those with the mnemonic can access a wallet.\n\nThis is why it's so important to understand and safeguard your mnemonic phrase!\n\nhttps://academy.solflare.com/what-is-a-mnemonic-phrase-and-how-does-it-work/\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor the first time in history, individuals can self-custody their own assets. Given that so many people are still unbanked and the banking system has so many problems, many are jumping straight from being unbanked to going bankless.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly evident in Africa and Southeast Asia, with high percentages of unbanked populations and high adoption rates of blockchain technology. As more of the world's unbanked population goes bankless, these individuals will begin to take advantage of the next generation of financial services and markets.\n\nThis will have massively positive ramifications for the future.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"a1:{\"title\":\"Unbanked to Bankless\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"Crypto fixes this\",\"tags\":\"$50\",\"image\":\"$51\"}\n9f:{\"id\":\"unbanked-to-bankless\",\"slug\":\"unbanked-to-bankless\",\"title\":\"Unbanked to Bankless\",\"content\":\"$a0\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/unbanked-to-bankless\",\"frontmatter\":\"$a1\",\"description\":\"Crypto fixes this\",\"tags\":\"$50\",\"image\":\"$51\"}\na3:T3281,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\nThis article is the first in a series of deep dives into Web 1, Web 2, and Web 3. It will examine the history, function, and legacy of Web 1 through the lens of the Strauss-Howe Generational Theory. \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nThe period from 1990-2005 is widely referred to as Web 1 and was defined by the Internet's primary function of content distribution. It preceded Web 2, which occurred between 2005 and 2020 and was characterized by user-generated content. Web 2 still dominates the Internet's format today, but the crypto industry has helped kickstart what is called Web 3, which is defined by user-owned networks. Web 1, 2, and 3's periods blend into one another as scalable innovation takes time.\n\n## Web Eras at a Glance\n\nFor clarity's sake, below is a one-line description of each\n\nWeb 1 = Content delivery networks. (1990-2004)\n\nWeb 2 = Content creation networks. (2004-Present)\n\nWeb 3 = User-owned networks. (2017-Present)\n\n# Strauss-Howe Generational Theory\n\nFor a deeper understanding of the cultural shifts underlying the advancements and applications of the Internet, this series distills a cross-generational perspective through the lens of the Strauss-Howe Generational Theory. The theory details a recurring cycle of generations that introduce archetypes with behavioral traits associated with the period in which they grew up. This series does not argue for the theory's validity but uses it to provide an anthropological angle through which we can view technological advancements.\n\nRather than detail each of the theory's components, the scope of this article will only pertain to the four generational shifts that occur before repeating. Below are descriptions of each generational period and their associated archetypes.\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-1-0.webp)\n\nEach period lasts about 20-23 years; the cycle repeats every 80-92 years. Although proponents of this theory observe its prevalence among all cultures, their study has focused on developments surrounding Europe and the US.\n\n## The Unraveling\n\nThe time period that Web 1 operated within, 1990-2004, coincided with the Unraveling as described in the Strauss-Howe theory. This era of the Unraveling, 1982-2004, began with \"triumphant individualism which drifted to a pervasive distrust of institutions and leaders.\"\n\nThe Unraveling / Web 1 presented a period when institutions were weak, individualism prospered, and society fragmented into many different factions. This perspective is directly connected to the ethos of the early Internet, which was full of idealistic visions of a more democratic and free society.\n\nAttempts were made to crystalize this ethos into the Internet, but they were unsuccessful as larger companies became the dominant digital forces. This centralization of power to a handful of content distribution channels had lasting ramifications on Web 1 and formed the roots for Web 2's monolithic intermediaries to flourish.\n\n## Generational Influences\n\nThe generation born into the era preceding the Unraveling, known as the Awakening, were Nomads. Theoretically, they grew up with a sense of alienation and insecurity due to the tumultuous time period in which they were raised. This, of course, is a generalization, but it highlights an important idea that in contrast to their childhood, Nomads are said to grow up to become practical and resilient adults.\n\nNomads were the prevailing leaders during this period of Unraveling, and they were met with resistance from the up-and-coming Millennial generation, which aligns with the Hero archetype. Heroes grow up to be optimistic and overconfident adults, and some come to wield enormous power, which efficiently describes leaders like Mark Zuckerberg – born in 1984.\n\nThese leaders, who \"move fast and break things,\" eventually became the incumbents in the industries they disrupted during the Unraveling. They then helped re-strengthen institutions through the business models implemented in the Crisis phase, which follows the Unraveling. It's a classic power transfer, and a new generation is gearing up to disrupt these Heroes using innovations from Web 3, but we'll get to that later.\n\nThis contemptuous relationship between Nomads and Heroes and the breaking down and rebuilding of traditional forms of corporate dominance were inherent features of Web 1. They directly influenced how Web 2 has played out. The world became privy to new forms of communication, and suddenly, every company needed a website. This is analogous to the early days of Web 3 when every person and company involved suddenly needed a wallet.\n\n## What Unraveled\n\nThe era directly after World War 2 was known as the High, defined by strong institutions and the homogeneity of ideas. Individuals were convening on how they wanted culture to move forward. Still, by the time US President John Kennedy was assassinated in 1962, this collective idealism was discarded, and burgeoning cultural movements prompted the next era, the Awakening, to begin.\n\nThese movements highlighted issues that those in charge during the High deemed insignificant, such as racial equality, sexual discrimination, and artistic expression. This Awakening period brought these issues to the forefront of public consciousness and began tarnishing the image of sublimity that the US had managed to muster. As you can imagine, individuals began strengthening their convictions while removing themselves from the institutions they used to identify with.\n\nIn summary, the High strengthened institutions through collective idealism; the Awakening introduced issues with the High's inherent infrastructure and empowered individuals to form their perspectives; and the Unraveling broke down and began rebuilding the industries that empowered the High through digital innovation (e.g., the internet / Web 1).\n\n# Historical Context\n\n## Individual Wealth \u0026 Global Supply Chains\n\nThe global stock market experienced unprecedented booms during the mid to late 1980s, creating enormous wealth for specific individuals and prompting the modern age of consumerism.\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-1-1.webp)\n\nThis also aligned with the globalization of supply chains, which enabled the free trade of goods in ways that never existed before. As companies took advantage of the benefits that outsourcing could bring to their bottom line, power began transmitting from domestic networks to a global supply chain layer with complex webs of intermediaries and agendas. This enabled individuals worldwide to figure out new ways to make money and led to a more distributed global economy.\n\n## Distrust, Adaption, \u0026 Obsoletion\n\nOil and gas, agricultural, tobacco, and auto manufacturing companies were continuously caught lying during the Awakening. The phenomenon of news anchors acting as talking heads with subjective takes on world events was taking over the airways instead of objective journalism. This caused unprecedented divides between viewers of different news outlets, and the public began forming smaller pockets of communities through which they would increasingly obtain information.\n\nInstitutions began adapting to this new Internet age, or they became obsolete. Looking forward, many companies that led the charge in Web 2's business model were master adopters of Web 1 or new entrants, and only time can tell what will happen in Web 3.\n\nGiven the advent of blockchains, non-custodial wallets, and NFTs – each of which enables users to own the networks they're a part of – it's safe to say that Web 3 has begun.\n\n# Web 1 Technical Evolution\n\n## Web 1 History\n\nThe Internet's genesis dates back to the early 1980s, but computer science has been a respected discipline since the 1950s. Major computing centers were being built worldwide but lacked adequate standardization, preventing network interoperability.\n\nThe Internet was born once the TCP/IP protocol was globally implemented and Tim Berners-Lee successfully communicated between a client and a server in 1989. Internet service providers (ISPs) soon began providing Internet to the public, and the first web page went live on August 6th, 1991.\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-1-2.webp)\n\nThe first website, and many more built during the 1990s, had severe limitations compared to today's websites. They typically contained text and hyperlinks, which brought you to another website with the same format and were read-only. As these websites evolved, the content distribution function of the Internet became more streamlined. By the year 2000, over 17 million websites and over 360 million people were browsing them.\n\nMany of these websites were variations of the image above and rarely involved user interaction. The Internet represented a collection of documents, although a few key innovations occurred in programming languages that helped lay the groundwork for Web 2.\n\n## Innovations\n\nNew programming languages can enable entirely new functionality within a computing system. When the web was first introduced, there were high barriers to entry, but as more programming languages were implemented, more specialized roles became available, such as UX/UI designers, back-end developers, and application engineers. This specialization dramatically lowered barriers to entry while radically enhancing the Internet itself.\n\n### HTML\n\nHyperText Markup Language (HTML) became publicly available in 1991 and enabled web browsers to combine text, images, and audio files to create a website. While HTML is functional in distributing content, it is severely limited in how the content is distributed.\n\n### CSS\n\nBefore the programming language CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was introduced in 1994, content and presentation were one and the same. With CSS, designers and developers could separate the two and concentrate on implementing the website's visual experience.\n\n### JS\n\nAlthough CSS was introduced in 1994, it didn't become mainstream until the early 2000s. Then, Javascript (JS) became more popular as Microsoft opted for it over the underdeveloped ECMAScript language. Microsoft was a monopoly during this time, monopolizing over 90% of the browser market through its Internet Explorer product, so this adoption of JS became widespread quite quickly.\n\nOver the years, many new languages have been implemented across the Internet, but HTML, CSS, and JS remain dominant.\n\n# Impact and Legacy\n\n## Setting the Stage\n\nAlthough Web 1 was built during an Unraveling phase, which implies weak institutions and a strong sense of individualism, it ironically set the stage for institutions to wield more power than ever before. Most of the heavy lifting was done by huge organizations like CERN, IBM, and Microsoft; these were the control entities.\n\nThe physical and digital infrastructure and the standards and protocols enacted by these intermediaries left significant gaps for future companies like Google and Facebook to fill in monopolistic fashions.\n\n## Deflationary Technology\n\nTechnology is deflationary in many respects because it makes things easier and cheaper.\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-1-4.webp)\n\nIt lowers the cost of production and creates economies of scale. Web 1 had high barriers to entry, which became shorter as the technology involved became more user-friendly. Individuals slowly gained more power as time passed, leading to rapid development and user interactivity through e-commerce websites, messaging services, and social media networks.\n\nThis newfound power of the individual in unison with destabilized institutions mirrors the features of the Unraveling periods.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAlthough the level of desired decentralization and democracy during Web 1 was not achievable then, it was necessary. Not only did it inspire a generation of technological innovation, but it set in motion cultural movements and design philosophies that are being actualized in blockchains and decentralized infrastructure today.\n\nInstitutions lost influence during Web 1 / The Unraveling as more people spent time forming their communities on the Internet. The exceptions to this were the tech companies that disrupted the incumbents while eventually becoming the new, more powerful institutions in the Crisis period. We'll cover that in Web 2.\n\nWeb 1 functioned as needed, enabling the mass adoption of the Internet and its idealism. The tenets of decentralized access to information and global interconnectivity are significant themes that have permeated through Web 2 and are experiencing a rebirth in Web 3.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"a4:{\"title\":\"Web 1\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"Content Delivery Networks\",\"tags\":\"$53\",\"image\":\"$54\"}\na2:{\"id\":\"web-1\",\"slug\":\"web-1\",\"title\":\"Web 1\",\"content\":\"$a3\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/web-1\",\"frontmatter\":\"$a4\",\"description\":\"Content Delivery Networks\",\"tags\":\"$53\",\"image\":\"$54\"}\na6:T44d6,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\nIn Web 1, we broke down the cultural and generational context of how the infrastructure for the modern Internet came to be and how it set in motion the innovations that led to Web 2 and 3.\n\nThis article will examine how these periods have been influenced by the generations involved, the issues of the incumbents, and the desires of the new entrants.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nSince the onset of Web 2, internet usage has been primarily oriented around user-generated content (social media and e-commerce). This has enabled monopolistic, rent-seeking intermediaries to take a stranglehold on physical and digital content distribution channels. Many companies have acquired undue influence over what billions of people see and buy.\n\n### Web Eras Defined\n\nFor clarity's sake, below is a one-line description of each period.\n\nWeb 1 = Content delivery networks. (1990-2004)\n\nWeb 2 = Content creation networks. (2004-Present)\n\nWeb 3 = User-owned networks. (2017-Present)\n\n# Generational Context\n\n## Strauss-Howe Analysis\n\nFor a deeper understanding of the cultural shifts underlying the advancements and applications of the Internet, this series will distill a cross-generational perspective through the lens of the Strauss-Howe Generational Theory. To reiterate, this series does not argue for the validity of the theory, but rather, it's used to provide an anthropological angle from which we can view technological advancements. The theory details a recurring cycle of generations that introduce archetypes who possess behavioral traits associated with the period in which they grew up.\n\nThe world theoretically entered a crisis phase with the onset of 9/11, although some argue it didn't take full effect until around 2008 when the Great Recession began. This period brought about an international war on terror, unprecedented military spending, global financial hardship, the rise of big tech, and political polarization unlike ever before due to social media and people obtaining their information online from a disparate web of subjective sources rather than for example just the New York Times.\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-2-0.webp)\n\n## Archetypes\n\nEach generation grows up in a different phase—either a High, an Awakening, an Unraveling, or a Crisis—and the context of these phases informs the types of individuals who emerge from them.\n\nBelow is a chart explaining the different features and desires of the four archetypes in this theory. Each archetype is entirely informed by the periods in which a generation was born, came of age, transition in midlife, and how they act and are perceived as elders.\n\nUPDATE PHOTO\n\n## Artists \u0026 Heroes\n\nThe generation of people born during a Crisis is referred to as Artists and are generally sensitive and overprotected as children yet very adaptive. Growing up during the Crisis phase presents many challenges, and, according to the theory, Artists are known to overcomplicate issues while coming to terms with their worldview. They do, however, grow up to be thoughtful, process-oriented adults.\n\nThis is a helpful frame of reference for viewing the Artist generation's starkly contrasting ideology to the previous Hero generation. Heroes were born during the phase preceding the Crisis, known as the Unraveling, and generally work under the doctrine of \"moving fast and breaking things\" because they grew up to be optimistic and overconfident leaders (e.g., Mark Zuckerberg).\n\nArtists have a big chip on their shoulders. They need to rearrange the world's complexity into a more consensus-oriented edifice with flexible yet relatively indecisive methods. Examples of Artists in history include some of America's founding fathers and former US president, Theodore Roosevelt. These individuals were \"sensitive and complex social technicians, advocates of fair play and the politics of inclusion.\" (Source)\n\n# The Rise of Crypto\n\nYou may see where we're going with this. Of course, every new generation grows up with more advanced technology than the last. Still, this most recent generation of artists grew up during the exponential internet adoption curve. Having a smartphone and social networks highlighting the inequality and calamities throughout every corner of the world has seriously impacted the Artist's psyche and led to many unforeseen ramifications.\n\nGiven that the Web was initially conceived as a decentralized resource but was stifled during this Web 2 phase, it's unsurprising to see the tenets of decentralization coming back in full force within Web 3. Heroes, still in charge during the Crisis phase, are less keen on decentralization because it would dethrone them from their puppet-master-like societal positions. Artists are keen on it because of their emphasis on equality. Their actions are increasingly moving towards a more decentralized world, and the crypto industry is not only an aspect of that, but it's the essence of it.\n\nTo better understand this transition from Web 1 to Web 3, let's break down Web 2's history and issues as it is a problematic and necessary bridge between generations and technologies.\n\n# Web 2 Evolution\n\n## History\n\nWeb 1's innovations laid the groundwork for Web 2 in the sense that the necessary software and hardware-related infrastructures had been set in place. Bustling economies were sprouting from all angles of the Internet, and many were excited about all the potential of this new interconnected world being built. Investors began throwing money at whatever internet companies they could until what became known as the Tech Bubble popped.\n\n## The Tech Bubble\n\nFinancial bubbles get a bad reputation because of the feral fervor and FOMO within them. Still, they are not often respected as the necessary component of technological adoption they are. Bubbles can show the masses the potential of something, but you need to know what parts will last.\n\nMany considered e-commerce a bubble until Amazon took over the commerce world. Similarly, many believed the crypto industry was a market bubble in 2017 as some far-fetched ideas were being speculated upon. While many of these ideas (like decentralized ride-sharing services) did not pan out, others, like NFTs and synthetic assets, have experienced the beginning innings of mass adoption. They will likely disrupt many industries in the coming years.\n\nTechnology doesn't work how humans think. Humans think linearly, and technology operates exponentially. This exponentiality eradicates the tried and true investment trope of mean reversion because exponential averages always increase at exponential rates. To understand this from a high level, consider how semiconductors conform to Moore's Law and technological networks conform to Metcalfe's Law.\n\n### Moore's Law\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-2-1.webp)\n\nAccording to Moore's Law, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (microchip) doubles every two years. As you can see in the graph below, Moore's Law has been proven to be true since Intel's microchips debuted in the early 1970s. These transistors improve computing power and enable technological advances that drive unforeseen societal changes across all industries.\n\n### Metcalfe's Law\n\nMetcalfe's Law defines the value of a telecommunications network as the squared product of the number of users in the network. In other words, Metcalfe's Law mathematically describes the power of network effects. As each new user is introduced to a network, they bring the capacity to introduce other new users and interact with the previous users. This creates an economy of interactions that exponentially expands as more people join the network while the cost of the network only increases linearly.\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-2-2.webp)\n\n# Key Innovations\n\n## Social Media\n\nOne of Web 1's most significant limitations was its static nature. Users could barely interact with sites, and aside from messaging, they could barely interact with each other. In 1999, Web 1 was compared to the embryo of the Web to come, and Web 2 began circulating. The term has been defined in various ways, although the common understanding of it being related to user-generated content was widely understood when social media networks took over.\n\nSocial media is arguably the most influential innovation that has come out of Web 2. It involves psychology, human behavior, mob mentality, marketing, real news, fake news, artificial intelligence, politics, music, media, and every facet of human nature. Near the end of Web 1, MySpace and Facebook entered the scene, and nothing was the same. These were the first social media networks that grabbed the world's attention, and it was now easier than ever to stay connected with friends, family, and strangers than ever before.\n\nPosting and interacting with the world opened doors to new creator economies and affected the direction humanity was heading. Humans have never had the power to learn anything and connect with anyone at any time. This facilitated unprecedented content creation, curation, interaction, and even whistleblowing, as there were now countless avenues through which people could distill and obtain their information.\n\n### Information Distillation\n\nIf you look at old photographs of people on public transportation, you'll often see everybody reading the same newspaper. This phenomenon instilled a homogeneity of ideas.\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-2-4.webp)\n\nIt's similar to how most people are now on their phones and have headphones on when riding public transportation, except now everyone is reading and listening to their algorithmically curated news feeds. These news feeds disrupted big media because anyone could make a media channel and distill information to their following, irrespective of their background or credentials.\n\nThis affects how news is distributed and ingested in many other areas of society. Rather than every comedian trying to land a spot on Saturday Night Live or a role in a big NBC network show that aired at 7 p.m. on Monday nights, for example, they can start a YouTube channel or a podcast, air their special on Netflix, or even star in their show offered by a streaming service and go viral.\n\nThis societal change in information distillation was one of the first steps to decentralization, but we still have a long way to go.\n\n## Ecommerce\n\nA few decades ago, Web 2's e-commerce innovations disrupted traditional commerce in unimaginable ways. Platforms like eBay, Etsy, Shopify, Amazon, Reverb, and thousands of other e-commerce websites enabled anyone to build a virtual store selling real-world goods and interact with other people's stores. Until Web 2, massive manufacturing firms and distribution outlets controlled what was sold and how people could buy things.\n\nWhile these firms still maintained market dominance through their e-commerce stores, the playing field was much higher than previously—countless stories of individuals building a niche online store and generating massive revenue. E-commerce has quickly become a standard operating procedure for celebrities with a devoted following.\n\nE-commerce doesn't only apply to real-world goods. It applies to any transaction made virtually. Disparate industries like gaming and sex work have been flipped upside down as platforms like Twitch and OnlyFans have generated hundreds of millions of dollars in paid subscriptions for their content creators. These platforms are entirely built on user-generated content and have their own novel sets of pros and cons dealt with in Web 3.\n\n# Challenges and Issues\n\n## Web 2's Business Model\n\nThe progress of Web 2 has brought about industry-changing platforms like Facebook, Amazon, and Google, which are very useful. Still, the users themselves are included as products in these business models.\n\nThe more you peruse Facebook, the more Facebook knows about you and how to market to you. The same things go for any centralized platform. Amazon will let you sell products on their site, learn from you if you're successful, and then implement what you did while placing your products behind their own in the search results.\n\nThese issues are readily apparent, and the Artist archetypes spearheading Web 3's developments are highly aware of them.\n\n## Privacy Concerns\n\nWhen Web 2 platforms began being adopted by the masses, all seemed good. You could do all sorts of amazing things that were impossible only a few years prior. As these platforms matured, their unintended side effects became more evident. To the unsuspecting eye, these free platforms and all the free things you could do on them seemed like the product being offered.\n\nThe reality is that the users of these platforms are the product, and it is very expensive to have your data measured and manipulated by centralized intermediaries.\n\n### Hacks \u0026 Data Leaks\n\nHacks and data leaks are common problems. A month ago, 7 million accounts on Robinhood had their data hacked and obtained by an anonymous third party. Other than changing its privacy policy and issuing an apology, there is nothing that Robinhood can do to right this wrong. They are not liable because they state the risk of these things happening in their terms and service. It's the user's fault for trusting Robinhood (especially after the Gamestop debacle).\n\n### Data Selling\n\nHave you ever Googled something you wanted to buy and suddenly had your Facebook feed filled with ads related to what you Googled? Facebook is known as one of the greediest data collectors, as these social media, browser, and commerce apps track each other's activities. They also partake in knowing what your friends are up to. If your Facebook friends have been searching for a couch to buy lately, the algorithms think you may be interested in purchasing a sofa, too, and all of a sudden, there will be couches and loveseats for sale all over your feed.\n\nThese centralized intermediaries will sell your data to other centralized intermediaries, and everyone is making money from you wasting away while staring at your device. The more you use these apps, the more money they earn and the more efficient they get at making it.\n\n## Censorship\n\nBlockchains and many of the innovations of Web 3 are much more censorship-resistant, but Web 2 is quite the opposite. Given the influence of these centralized intermediating monopolies, they can prevent you from using their services for any reason.\n\nThis is a huge issue when it comes to free speech and whistleblowing. Whistleblowers need free speech as their purpose is to publicly present data that has been locked behind closed doors by these centralized intermediaries and governing bodies.\n\n## Fake News\n\nWeb 2 enabled individuals to create content networks, drastically changing how society ingests said content. The ramifications of this paradigm shift are both positive and negative. It's now easier than ever to fabricate news or share toxic worldviews with no consequence. Nefarious actors can infiltrate an emerging market and manipulate societal belief systems and political elections while spreading distrust in centralized governance systems. This is a result of the decentralization of mass media, which has some significant benefits along with these listed downsides.\n\nWhen everyone used to read the New York Times every day, they ingested the same content. Now, hundreds of networks exploit the 24/7 news cycle to compete for users' attention spans by creating clickbait, which is false, misleading, or unverified news meant to initiate engagement.\n\nIt has been well-documented that negative and bombastic headlines spur digital engagement more than positive and objective ones within social media algorithms. This divides social sentiment and creates unhealthy dynamics between people who otherwise would have had nothing to do with one another. You can trace these engagement metrics back to the mid-1990s when Fox News and other media outlets began substituting objective anchors with subjective talking heads.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAn archetype will not give birth to a similar archetype but rather a contrasting one.\n\nThe Hero generation disrupted the Nomad generation and began deconstructing and rebuilding the institutions built before them. Artists grew up in the Hero's world and felt similar needs to deconstruct and rebuild but with a more sensitive and equality-based perspective.\n\nWith all of Web 2's downsides, and there are plenty, it truly is a marvel how interconnected the world has become over the last few decades. It has created trillions of dollars in market capitalization, helped bring millions out of poverty, and has minted more millionaires and billionaires than any other period in history while enabling humans to have powers that could only be dreamed of a few decades ago - even more so with Web 3 once Bitcoin and wallets made self-custody widespread. The Artist generation recognizes this progress along with the problematic caveats it entails.\n\nAs the financial world crumbled during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008, an anonymous developer, Satoshi Nakamoto, combined the innovations that led the crypto revolution to where it is today into the Bitcoin blockchain, and the rest is history.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"a7:{\"title\":\"Web 2\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"Content Creation Networks\",\"tags\":\"$56\",\"image\":\"$57\"}\na5:{\"id\":\"web-2\",\"slug\":\"web-2\",\"title\":\"Web 2\",\"content\":\"$a6\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"link\":\"/writing/web-2\",\"frontmatter\":\"$a7\",\"description\":\"Content Creation Networks\",\"tags\":\"$56\",\"image\":\"$57\"}\na9:T519d,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n\u003cstyle jsx\u003e{`\n .prose a {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    color: var(--color-accent);\n }\n .prose ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    margin-left: 2em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */\n    padding-left: 0.5em; /* Add padding if needed */\n }\n .prose ol li {\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n    color: var(--color-text-primary);\n    line-height: 1.5; /* Adjust line height for better readability */\n }\n`}\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"tldr-section\"\u003e\n\nWeb 3 is a technical philosophy that has disrupted previous internet models by empowering users to take more ownership of the products they're using.\n\nSome say it's a fugazi, and others may define it differently than how you understand it, but there's no denying that users' relationship with the Internet is changing.\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## The Evolution of the Web\n\n### Web 1: The Unraveling and Web 2: The Crisis\n\nWeb 1: The Unraveling and Web 2: The Crisis broke down the series of events, innovations, and issues that brought the Internet to its current state. We live in a predominantly digital era, and most websites today still follow the Web 2 business model, where the users are the ultimate product.\n\nWeb 2 is the necessary bridge between Web 1 and Web 3, but it presents a pandora's box of issues regarding privacy concerns, censorship, and content distribution. This stems from the centralized intermediaries that have become monopolies over the past few decades. They govern news feeds, browser searches, and how people connect and spend their time online.\n\nThis article will explain how users of Web 3 can own the networks they're a part of, how open source ideology is transforming the fabric of the Internet, and how Web 3 generates unforeseen value.\n\nFor clarity, below is a one-line description of each period.\n\nWeb 1 = Content delivery networks. (1990-2004)\n\nWeb 2 = Content creation networks. (2004-Present)\n\nWeb 3 = User-owned networks. (2017-Present)\n\n## The Promise of Web 3\n\nThroughout this deep dive series, different eras of the Internet have been viewed through the Strauss-Howe Generational Theory, which details a recurring cycle of archetypal generations.\n\nThese archetypes possess behavioral traits associated with the period in which they grew up as the surrounding context and coming of age of these generations directly influence how they view the world and behave as adults.\n\n### Artists \u0026 Heroes\n\nAccording to the theory, the generation known as Artists grew up during the Crisis period (2001-present), and we left off with them butting heads with the Hero generation who grew up during the Unraveling Period (1982-2000). Heroes like Mark Zuckerberg (Born 1982) and Evan Spiegel (Born 1990) are in monopolistic positions of power and are often unreflective and overbold.\n\nArtists, on the other hand, are known to grow up into thoughtful adults as they tend to emphasize equality and practicality in contrast to the chaotic indecisiveness they inherited from the context of their upbringing. The divide between these two groups is very much a result of the impending power transfers that Web 3 is enabling.\n\nHeroes are not in a position where they want to decentralize their control. Web 2 has worked out very well for those in power as magnificent wealth has been generated at the cost of users' privacy and autonomy. The Artist archetypes, acting as the underdogs, are participating in Web 3 and see massive opportunities for disruption. However, most of the generation is still confined to the restraints of Web 2 due to their digital lives being maintained by Web 2 platforms.\n\n## Economic Context\n\n### Assets \u0026 Valuations\n\nArtists are growing up during a period in which asset valuations worldwide are at unprecedented levels. This is usually the case as global GDP grows, but the rate of change in asset price rise has never been this parabolic. From a traditional economic standpoint, the fact that interest rates have been declining for multiple decades is also a sign of a fragile global economy.\n\nWith stocks and risky assets at all-time highs and bonds and risk-free assets yielding all-time lows, where should all the money go?\n\n## The Role of Cryptocurrency\n\n### Crypto\n\nOne method of working around the present system is decentralizing control and building new assets. The crypto industry has introduced more innovation and financial products than most people can keep up with, and these assets serve entirely new use cases. They don't fit the molds that traditional finance has created.\n\nBalaji Srinivasan has a great quote that sums up the enhancements being implemented:\n\n\"Tokens are not securities in the same way that YouTube is not Television.\"\n\nSome tokens may have qualities that mimic securities, but they also have new attributes that regulatory frameworks have not defined. These qualities effectively enable users to own the networks they are a part of.\n\nAs Balaji puts it, YouTube is not television.\n\n### User-Owned Networks\n\nWhen the web was first envisioned, developers had a utopian perspective of free information, borderless interconnectivity, and individual solidarity. This was all good in theory, but in practice, the web was controlled by a handful of companies who now have far too much influence on humanity's trajectory. Web 3's focus on decentralization and interoperability looks to dismantle this paradigm and usher in a more equitable and capable internet.\n\nYou may think that user-owned networks have existed for a long time, given that you can invest in a company's stock, but it's not the same. Investing in companies requires far more barriers to entry than participating in a network does. This concept is best described with a simple thought experiment: Imagine being paid in Facebook shares based on your value to the platform. Although it can be difficult to quantify value, this new user engagement model incentivizes value creation and ultimately beckons a better Facebook for all network users. This benefits the users and Facebook. Win-win. So why wouldn't Facebook do this?\n\nFirst, Facebook went live in 2004, over a decade before Ethereum's private sale. Ethereum was the first programmable blockchain because it enabled smart contracts, and its innovations were necessary for user-owned networks to be possible. Smart contracts allowed the ERC20 and ERC721 standards to exist, which have since changed the entire crypto landscape from innovations in financial plumbing to creator tools.\n\n### ERC20 \u0026 ERC721 Standards\n\nERC20 tokens enabled anyone to deploy a fungible token to the Ethereum blockchain, and ERC721 tokens enabled anyone to deploy a *non-*fungible token (NFT) to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThese standards have inspired others and have been implemented across chains, including Solana, Ethereum, and Avalanche. In each of these cases, users can now own the network they are a part of – at least a part of it in some sense. No standards even remotely similar to these existed when Facebook hit the market, as there were no blockchains on which these standards could operate.\n\n### Cryptocurrency as Equity\n\nIf you ask most financial advisors right now how to position your portfolio about cryptocurrencies and equities, your answer would probably be 95% equities and 5% crypto or even 0% crypto. This draws a clear line in the sand between cryptocurrencies and equities when they are more alike than different.\n\nSure, some cryptocurrencies serve zero use cases and are nothing more than speculative instruments, but others are entire networks. If you were to invest in ETH, SOL, or AVAX, you would own a piece of these networks, and this tradable ownership could be considered equity. Tokens, such as the ones conforming to the ERC20 standard, are built and deployed atop these networks.\n\nEach of these tokens has its use case, tokenomics, and distribution schedule that should be diligently researched before being speculated upon. NFA.\n\n## Innovations in Fundraising\n\n### Fund Raising\n\nAnother vital component of Web 3 thus far has been the innovations in the fundraising industry. Traditionally, startup companies have either gone through a series of venture capital funding rounds or have been bootstrapped. This was until Mastercoin implemented the world's first Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2013, an innovation that spurred the imagination of many investors later on during the 2017 ICO bubble.\n\nThis bubble, which was relatively similar to the Tech Bubble but at a much smaller scale, displayed the excitement people had about how projects and companies could now raise money. Some were raising a lot of money, which attracted a few nefarious actors and influencers like John McAfee and Floyd Mayweather, who promoted low-quality projects that essentially went to zero. The ICO industry has since evolved into multiple variations of ICOs that each serve different purposes. These will impact Web 3's fundraising and development going forward.\n\nFor the record, there are still \\*\\*far too many nefarious influencers promoting garbage. Kim Kardashian promoted Ethereum Max. Influencers like BitBoy are constantly up to no good. When money is involved, anything can happen, so be wary of who you follow.\n\n### ICO / IDO / ITO / IAO / Etc.\n\nICOs are a spin-off of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), the traditional method of large-scale fundraising for companies looking to enter the public markets. So, it's not surprising that there are so many ICO spin-offs. These include but are not limited to the following:\n\n![Web Evolution Image](/images/web-3-0.webp)\n\n### NFTs\n\nNFTs have endless utilities. Just think of them as a medium to facilitate digital ownership. Their fundraising potential has only begun to be tapped and will likely affect how many projects finance their operations. They're not just PFPs - but PFPs have been blasting off recently.\n\n#### Aurory\n\nAurory recently issued 10,000 Aurorians, becoming one of Solana's most traded NFT projects. This resulted in 1,000 SOL (~$180,000) in minting sales and passive, perpetual income due to secondary sales.\n\nThen, the developing team raised over $108 million with an IDO.\n\nAnyone who minted and held an Aurorian has experienced significant price appreciation, personal relationships with others who own (and perhaps identify) with Aurorians, and a financial stake in the project's development.\n\n#### The Infinite Garden\n\n![infinite Image](/images/web-3-2.webp)\n\nThere is also a documentary titled Ethereum: The Infinite Garden that raised nearly 1,036 ETH, now valued at over $4 million, through the sales of NFTs associated with the movie.\n\n#### 3LAU\n\nElectronic music producer 3LAU decided to list his previously released album from several years ago for sale as an NFT, and he netted over $11 million. This has enabled him to finance projects such as Royal.io, which is intended to disrupt the music royalty industry with NFTs.\n\n## Blockchain \u0026 Project Grants\n\nIf you follow crypto-related content on LinkedIn and casually scroll through your newsfeed, you'll be hard-pressed not to find articles related to new blockchain investment funds. Blockchains and DeFi projects are constantly doling out grants meant to help improve their surrounding ecosystem.\n\nGrants are great. They've historically been able to fund essential projects within academia and elsewhere, but they've recently taken their funding game to the next level due to crypto-related innovations like DAOs.\n\n### Gitcoin\n\n![Fundraising Image](/images/web-3-3.webp)\n\nGitcoin was designed to enable the funding of public goods. These goods are often open-source software, so many grants go to coders, developers, and founders. Gitcoin grants are decided upon by the Gitcoin DAO, which is composed of GTC holders. Gitcoin's definition of public goods is based on non-rivalrous and non-profitable endeavors, usually related to public digital infrastructure.\n\nGitcoin has instituted quadratic funding, which, in summary, gives projects with the most backers priority in terms of financing compared to projects with ample funding but fewer backers. For more details, read Vitalik's post on his website and all his other posts for good measure.\n\n### Treasury Grants \u0026 DAOs\n\nDAOs are still unproven, yet their utility and benefits seem hopeful. Their legal status and funding mechanisms are still grey areas, although some have successfully implemented payments to participants and projects in their communities. We'll see how it goes.\n\nMy favorite example of this is NounsDAO.\n\nNounsDAO is an ambitious NFT project that will mint one noun every day forever. After 103 days, these Nouns' sale prices are averaging well above 100 ETH, and each signifies entrance into NounsDAO. Smart contracts govern the entire project, and 100% of every sale is deposited into the community's treasury, which at the time of writing holds over 14,456 ETH, or $69,388,800. That's an average revenue stream and profit of $673,677.67 per day. Good luck finding any startup with those numbers.\n\nThis treasury is used to help build products and projects surrounding the Noun community, such as Nouns.com, a hot or not game between pairs of different Nouns, and even a hangout area built within the CryptoVoxels metaverse. They also decided to donate 30 ETH to charity; you can see their record. Below is an image of transactions from their public treasury wallet.\n\n![Open Source Image](/images/web-3-4.webp)\n\nImagine a crypto-friendly city like Miami, Lisbon, or New York deciding to level its transparency and operate all financial transactions on a public blockchain. It probably won't happen, but it could with a Web 3 framework. NounsDAO is silly but most innovations on the Internet start silly.\n\n## Open Source and Interoperability\n\n### Open Source\n\nBlockchains are the fundamental settlement layers of all the Web 3 applications being built, and public blockchains are open source. These on-chain applications are also open source, which helps explain the ridiculous level of development that occurs within the crypto industry every year. Developers usually have access to the entire backend of an app, and functions can be forked, copied, and expanded upon.\n\n### Money Legos\n\nInteroperability is the property of Web 3 that allows these DeFi applications to interact with one another. You can now cultivate and manage your wealth trustlessly and permissionlessly.\n\nUtilizing DeFi, investors have many options, from generating a yield on a borrowed asset while maintaining exposure to the collateral to supplying liquidity to an AMM that rewards them with trading fees. Yieldless and yield-bearing tokens are all interoperable. Below is a simple example of how to do so.\n\nStake SOL using Marinade and receive mSOL.\nDeposit SOL/mSOL into a liquidity pool and earn trading fees.\nVoila, you are earning a yield (Transaction fees from the SOL/mSOL pool) on both a yieldless asset (SOL) and a yield-bearing asset (mSOL).\n\n### Decentralized Dashboards\n\nMoney managers and banks custody assets and need ways of keeping tabs on them. While financial dashboards may not seem important to most people, they're products that can lower one's need for any bank or money manager. They're tools for you to go bankless.\n\nDeFi enables you to do everything you can in traditional finance and more in a permissionless and trustless fashion. In Web 2 and conventional finance, you can connect your banking and investment accounts to dashboards like Mint and Copilot, but you must divulge all your accounts' information. In Web 3, you can have multiple wallets operating across multiple chains doing complicated activities such as providing liquidity, borrowing, or utilizing synthetic assets and displaying them within one interface.\n\nWhen you connect to a multichain wallet dashboard like DeBank, your activity will be present, filterable, and graphically represented. Other worthy dashboards include ApeBoard, YieldWatch, and SonarWatch. These dashboards not only give you the ability to self custody your money, but they do so without having any access to your information aside from your public wallet address and your blockchain balances.\n\n### Forks\n\nGood artists borrow, and great artists steal. - Pablo Picasso\n\nSuch is the case for many DeFi protocols, as they are often forked versions of each other with attempted enhancements. Forking can enable unprecedented levels of innovation but also allow bad actors to make nefarious platforms very quickly, especially on blockchains with low fees like Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Forks ultimately provoke competition and help instill a constant need for projects to stay on their toes rather than become complacent.\n\nAn infamous example of a forked project is SushiSwap. During the DeFi Summer of 2020, Uniswap was the go-to DEX for most people, as its daily volume surpassed Coinbase. A competitor called SushiSwap came along and forked the project while adding an enhanced incentive reward system through its issue of SUSHI tokens.\n\nThis drained Uniswap of a substantial volume, and they responded by issuing an airdrop of UNI tokens to anyone who had participated on the platform earlier. UNI token holders govern the platform, and UNI's market capitalization has since risen to nearly $13 billion at the time of writing. SUSHIi's market cap is just over $2 billion.\n\n## Generating Value\n\n### Liquidity Pools\n\nTo learn more about Liquidity Pools in detail, read this. For the sake of this article, you need to understand that liquidity pools enable anyone to provide liquidity for somebody else to trade off pseudonymously. In traditional finance, these liquidity providers are market makers.\n\nThese pools generate trading fees transmitted to the liquidity providers and, in many cases, to a community-governed treasury. The liquidity providers are earning a yield that doesn't exist for retail participants in traditional finance. Its creation is a byproduct of using non-custodial wallets and AMMs built within liquidity pools.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Token Terminal's home page, which displays the profitability metrics such as Price/Sales and Price/Earnings ratios of each DeFi protocol and underlying blockchain.\n\n![Open Source Image](/images/web-3-5.webp)\n\n## Moatless\n\nIndustries have been defined by centralized intermediaries building and investors obsessing over economic moats, which are facets of a business that separate it from others.\n\nIn theory, moats exist in Web 3 but don't serve the same purpose as in Web 1 and 2. Sure, innovation is incentivized and rewarded, but the competition is unbridled due to the open-source nature of development. When more eyes are looking at something, more mistakes are noticed.\n\nYou'll continue to hear stories of white-cap hackers that expose vulnerabilities in open-source protocols in return for a reward or just for the good of the community. This inadvertently generates massive amounts of value by securing the network.\n\n### White Cap Hackers\n\nA hacker stole over $600 million from the Polygon Layer 2 scaling solution, and it was all returned. The Polygon team then attempted to recruit the hacker, but he declined by responding with messages written into smart contracts, such as the one below.\n\n![Open Source Image](/images/web-3-6.webp)\n\nAnother hacker exposed an 850 million dollar vulnerability and was awarded a 2 million bug bounty.\n\nThis value generation through white cap hacking and bug bounties was not an intended consequence of Web 3, but it is a happy accident. Unfortunately, black cap hacking is still an issue, as over 70 DeFi exploits have resulted in losses of over $1.5 billion.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nWhile most of the world still operates under the umbrella that Web 2 is holding out, every day, more people are switching their desired internet use to function in ways that only Web 3 enables. Heroes are either adapting to this new paradigm or fighting it off. The Artist generation recognizes this along with the inherent issues of Web 2 and the immense value propositions of Web 3.\n\nIt's a complex web of financial and security-related innovation and an even more complex web of communities fusing to form a global perspective. This perspective is naturally more decentralized and permissionless than the centralized vision of Web 2, and it aligns more with the original, idealistic vision of the World Wide Web that the early developers had at the beginning of Web 1.\n\nSome people doubt that this new paradigm exists or has any foundation, the same way they doubted that a website can safely store their credit card information.\n\nThe world has evolved and will continue to do so, but the implications will be staggering once Web 3's innovations are adopted into the mainstream. This adoption may take a while due to governmental bodies, UX considerations, regulatory restrictions, and financial incumbents wanting to remain in control. Still, fortunately for the world, Web 3 is not just around the corner. It's already here.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"aa:{\"title\":\"Web 3\",\"date\":\"2024-10-25\",\"featured\":false,\"draft\":false,\"description\":\"User-owned
