Not once have I been recommended by a teacher, doctor, or wellness resource to nose breathe, yet everyone knows that mouth breathing is wrong.

James Nestor found out why and went above and beyond to explain the importance of nose breathing. it doesn't make sense as to why modern medical science isn't more focused on this. I've never heard about it from a teacher or doctor, even though there is so much proven value in breathing correctly. This book details the disastrous effects of mouth breathing and does a great job of scaring you into caring. The TLDR is - every time you breathe through your mouth, you're breathing inferior air than if you were to breathe through your nose, and you will probably die sooner.

The first book by James Nestor,{' '} Deep

, was described as "renegade science," which gives you an idea of how to expect some of it
to come across. It gets gross but not too clinical, which is helpful because some books
about science feel like textbooks and lose the reader.

This one is an easy listen/read, and it's become a bit of a cult classic with an annual
Breath retreat in Costa Rica.
