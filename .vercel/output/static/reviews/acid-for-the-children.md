Flea's memoir is a raw, honest, and impactful account of his youth and the formation of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. With short, engaging chapters and narration by the man himself, Flea delivers a great listening experience through the audiobook that offers unique insights into his life and the early days of RHCP.

Writing Style and Content
Flea uses short chapters to tell both funny and heart-wrenching stories that shaped him, and he narrates them in his honest tone. He's not trying to prove anything and goes into detail about his upbringing and the early days of the Chili Peppers but stops before they reach superstardom.

Like many young musicians, I had an strong obsession with John Frusciante's solos from his time with the Red Hot Chili Peppers - starting with the solo he improvised live at the end of Parallel Universe at Slane Castle. The only note for Flea in this book would be to include more content about John, but I digress. Because of this obsession, I learned all of RHCP's best songs on guitar, even performed Can't Stop in a high school talent show, and have intimately studied the deep cuts - where I've developed a deep respect for Flea. BloodSugarSexMagic's bass and guitar lines are foundational funk.

Its a Good One
Having a basic understanding of the band gave me enough context to work with, and Flea does nothing but deliver. He is a legend, and if you like people, read this book. If you like music, watch{' '} this improvised intro at Slane castle between Flea and Frusciante. You can also learn it on Songsterr{' '} here .
