Brave New World is one of the few books that I've read multiple times. I had to read it in high school - I barely did - and then I decided to read it again in college because I learned more about how ahead of his time Aldous Huxley was. Now having read it for the third time, I can say that it's a must read for anyone.

Aldous published this in 1931, and it will still be relevant in 3131 and beyond. While the story may seem derivative because everyone copies him, he hit the nail on the head with this one.

I suggest sailing to The Island after you finish.
