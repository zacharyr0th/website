# _Seeing Like a State_

**by James C. Scott**  
_Reviewed by Zachary Roth_

Much like _The Sovereign Individual_—which I reviewed in my first issue—_Seeing Like a State_ has good ideas buried under an overconfident tone. The content is valuable, but the author's arrogance is hard to ignore. Maybe it was the narrator, but the whole thing gave off strong "elbow patch" energy.

The repetition is wild. I’d skip to the middle of a chapter, and Scott would still be unpacking the same example from earlier. The first half of the book had me engaged, but I started skimming later—and honestly, I don’t think I missed much.

Save yourself some time: find a high-quality YouTube video that summarizes it instead.

**TL;DR:** Interesting thesis, but overwritten and repetitive. Better as a video essay than a full read.
