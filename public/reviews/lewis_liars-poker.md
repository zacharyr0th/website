I wouldn’t read this again—but it launched Michael Lewis, and the world (and Hollywood) has benefited from that.

It made me want to write a book. And if you're in finance, this should be required reading. It captures a moment, a mindset, and a madness that still echoes through the industry today.

**TL;DR:** A foundational finance memoir. Not perfect, but pivotal—and a spark for anyone thinking about writing their own.
