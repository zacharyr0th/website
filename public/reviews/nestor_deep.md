_Deep_ is exactly what it sounds like—an immersive dive into the ocean, not just physically but biologically, technologically, and even spiritually. James Nestor takes readers through the ocean’s vertical layers, chapter by chapter, each titled by depth: -30 ft, -600 ft, and so on. At each level, he explains what happens in the water—and how humans have somehow adapted to it.

The early chapters focus on freediving, which ends up being the strongest part of the book. It’s niche, under-reported, and incredibly competitive. You get a look at what the human body can withstand, and what people are doing at the edge of that limit. Nestor’s ability to bring obscure subcultures to light is one of his strengths—he does the same in _Breath_. In fact, he mentions how he was perceived as a freediving expert simply because no one else was writing about it. Many such cases.

Another standout moment: James Cameron—the director of _Titanic_ and _Avatar_—going to the bottom of the ocean solo in a submarine. Thats pretty scary.

**TL;DR:** _Deep_ is part science, part adventure, and part meditation on our connection to the ocean. If you’re even a little curious about what lies beneath and how we're involved, it’s a rewarding read.
