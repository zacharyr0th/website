# _Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe_

I wanted to love this book. The title is strong, the author has a witty mind and track record, but the execution didn’t land. _Doom_ promises a sweeping look at how societies handle catastrophe—but what we mostly get is an extended COVID-19 postmortem, recycled across chapters.

The book aims to explore the politics of disaster management across history, but ends up feeling repetitive and narrow in scope. Many of Ferguson’s points are good—especially around institutional failure and risk mismanagement—but they’re hammered so often that they lose impact. I found myself disengaged well before the halfway mark.

Maybe it’s burnout. Maybe it’s the timing. But for a book about catastrophe, it doesn’t offer much that feels fresh or enduring. There are glimmers of classic Ferguson—sharp insights, historical sweeps with connections across decades—but they’re buried under a loop of pandemic-era analysis that already feels overplayed. I had just lived through it and generally, it sucked.

**TL;DR:** Great title, strong author, but too much focus on well-covered issues surrounding COVID. Skim if you’re still curious, skip if you’re already fatigued on public health topics.
