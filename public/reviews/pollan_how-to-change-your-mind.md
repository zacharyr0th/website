This could’ve been a great entry point into the world of psychedelic medicine—but I wasn’t the right audience. I went in hoping for updates on the science, new insights, or even some bold thinking. What I got felt flat and obvious. If you’ve been casually following developments in this field for a while, there’s nothing new here.

I’ve kept an eye on psychedelic research for the past decade, so maybe it’s unfair to expect something groundbreaking. Still, I was bored, skipping around, and eventually quit the book early. The writing felt overly cautious and safe—like it was designed to be as palatable as possible to a mainstream audience.

Because of that, I probably won’t read anything else by Michael Pollan. His voice didn’t click for me—too vanilla, too polished. But again, if you're new to the topic and want a modern overview, this might be the perfect introduction.

**TL;DR:** A decent intro to psychedelics if you’re new to the topic. If you’re not, it’ll feel like old news.
