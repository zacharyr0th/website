# _Guns, Germs, and Steel_

I listened to this a few months after finishing all four of Peter Zeihan’s books, and there are definite parallels—especially in the focus on geography and geopolitics. That said, Diamond is more conservative in his conclusions and, honestly, a more boring author. Not necessarily a flaw, just not my style.

Still, you have to give Jared credit: he helped launch an entire subgenre of economic and geopolitical history. A lot of writers today are building on the foundations laid here—mixing geography, anthropology, and macroeconomics to explain the structure of the modern world.

My only real critique is that the book sometimes paints too neat a picture. The clarity of the conclusions can feel a little forced. It reminded me of the "legibility" critique in \_Seeing Like a State. Sometimes the forest looks clean and orderly from above—but on the ground, things are much messier.

**TL;DR:** A foundational book in modern macro-history. A bit dry, but worth it for the ideas.
