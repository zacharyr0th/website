I hold Camila in high regard and have followed her work at _The Defiant_ for a while. _The Infinite Machine_ is essential reading for crypto people—and a solid pick for anyone into tech or finance. It walks through the birth of Ethereum, told by those who were there when it happened.

The writing is sharp and understated, backed by deep research.

A few years ago, I audiobooked _Jobs_ by Walter Isaacson. The Steve Jobs parts? Great. The endless chapters on his entourage? Not so much. Camila avoids that pitfall. She gives just the right amount of attention to Vitalik, Charles, Gavin, and the rest of Ethereum’s core cast.

**TL;DR:** A well-written, well-researched origin story of Ethereum. Perfect for crypto fans and tech-curious readers alike.
