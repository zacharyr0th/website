# _Life After Google_

This book is wild—and visionary in a way only George Gilder can pull off. _Life After Google_ argues that the current centralized model of the internet, dominated by data-hungry giants like Google, is on its way out. In its place? A decentralized future built on blockchain, cryptography, and individual sovereignty.

At times, the writing can get a little grandiose, but the ideas are sharp. Gilder connects economic history, tech evolution, and philosophical theory into one sweeping prediction about where things are heading.

You don’t have to agree with all of it to find it thought-provoking. If you’re interested in blockchain beyond the hype—or want a glimpse of what the internet could become—this is a solid, if occasionally dense, read.

**TL;DR:** A bold, sometimes chaotic vision of a decentralized internet. Ideal for techno-futurists and curious skeptics alike.
