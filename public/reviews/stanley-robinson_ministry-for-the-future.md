# _The Ministry for the Future_

As _Overstory_ explains the mindset of the environmental movement from the 1960s, _Ministry_ imagines what the future could look like if those warnings aren’t taken seriously.

I won’t spoil too much, but the book opens with a brutal depiction of climate change effects on a region with a relatively small carbon footprint. As many have noted, one of the more tragic realities of climate change is that the countries least responsible will often suffer the most—at least at first.

What follows is a globe-spanning narrative filled with policy ideas, sci-fi tech, and climate interventions. Around the 17-hour mark, I started to lose the thread a bit—but it’s still great. I plan to re-listen someday. There are too many smart, not-too-far-off ideas packed in here to not revisit.

That’s the power of speculative fiction: authors float a vision, and decades later, some polymath connects the dots and changes the world.

**TL;DR:** Dense but important. A big, bold vision of the climate future—realistic enough to be haunting.
