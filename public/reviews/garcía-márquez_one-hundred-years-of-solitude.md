# _One Hundred Years of Solitude_

Exhausting—but so good. Easily top 5 for the year, maybe even all-time for fiction. That said, I’ll probably never listen to or read it again.

It’s wildly imaginative and written for an adult audience, full of vibrant language that feels like a barrage of colorfully translated words. Even the names have a kind of music to them—three-part names that roll off the tongue in this rhythmic, lyrical way.

The story tracks seven generations of a single family. Every time a character is introduced, their full name is repeated—often—which makes the audiobook feel a bit intense. Still, it works. It gets repetitive, sure, but the ending lands well and it digs into both external and internal aspects of the human experience.

If you're into fiction, this one's essential.

**TL;DR:** Lush, lyrical, and legendary. A dense read, but unforgettable. For fiction fans, it’s non-negotiable.
