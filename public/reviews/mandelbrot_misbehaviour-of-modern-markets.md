# _The Misbehaviour of Markets_

**by Benoit Mandelbrot**  
_Reviewed by Zachary Roth_

Benoit Mandelbrot was one of the world’s top mathematicians, especially known for his work in fractal geometry. In this book, he brings those ideas into finance—showing how his mathematical models uncover hidden patterns in market behavior.

It’s a dry read at times, but Benoit is brilliant. You’ll wish you had found this book sooner. I read it about ten months ago and don’t remember every detail—but I do remember being fully engaged.

**TL;DR:** Smart, technical, and ahead of its time. A must-read for anyone who wants to look at markets through a more mathematical (and chaotic) lens.
