_The Sovereign Individual_ is an important book filled with insights everyone should at least be familiar with. But it's also a long-winded essay by eurocentric, occasionally paranoid doomsayers. Many of its predictions about technology’s relationship with society have aged surprisingly well—or at least landed close enough to reality to explain its lasting relevance.

It’s hard to say whether that accuracy is due to genuine foresight or simply the result of throwing every idea at the wall and seeing what sticks. The book leans heavily on prediction, but often presents claim after claim with little to no evidence. That gets tiring fast. Some of its more speculative conclusions have aged poorly—everything it had to say about Y2K, for example, is now more amusing than alarming.

Having worked full-time in crypto since 2019, I see clearly why this book resonates so deeply within the industry. Its focus on self-sovereignty and individual empowerment aligns closely with the ethos of crypto, particularly around ideas like self-custody. I’ve written at length about that concept elsewhere—and this book makes for a strong philosophical foundation if you’re already aligned with that worldview.

That said, readers should approach the authors' outlook with caution. The book offers a compelling mental model for viewing technological change, but there’s also a layer of paranoia and elitism that peeks through more than once. You can almost see the elbow patches on their blazers and see the tin foil in their hats.

**TL;DR:** It's a sharp mental exercise wrapped in some eccentric packaging. Read it for the framework, not for the prophecy.

Overall, _The Sovereign Individual_ is worth the read for the strength of its ideas alone. It opens conceptual doors about the future that few books attempt to crack, and despite its flaws, it’s an enduring artifact of techno-political speculation.
