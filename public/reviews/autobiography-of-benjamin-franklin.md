It is refreshing to read the personal account of a level-headed individual during a time when humanity was not. Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is similar, but this one is funny.

I'm no Benjamin Franklin historian, but I know he was a frisky individual and a powerful freemason - this book doesn't get into that at all, as it mainly highlights the thought processes of a revolutionary polymath who impacted the trajectory of history.

You'll like this one if you're into history.
