# _Four Thousand Weeks_

This was my final audiobook of the year, and fittingly, it’s a book about endings—or more specifically, the finite nature of our relation to time. _Four Thousand Weeks_ refers to the average human lifespan in weeks. That number is jarring, but also grounding.

Burkeman doesn’t offer productivity hacks or time-saving tricks. Instead, he leans into the uncomfortable truth that we won’t get to do everything we want to do. Not even close. The book’s central thesis is that recognizing this limitation is freeing—not paralyzing—and it offers a different kind of clarity about what really matters and how we should choose to spend our time.

You can’t outrun mortality with better scheduling. But you can choose where to place your attention, and who or what gets your best hours. Burkeman walks that line thoughtfully, mixing philosophy and practicality with a tone that’s neither too somber nor overly optimistic.

**TL;DR:** _Four Thousand Weeks_ is a grounded, philosophical take on time management—less about doing more, and more about doing what matters.
