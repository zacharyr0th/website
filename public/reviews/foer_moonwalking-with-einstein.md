In _MwE_, Joshua Foer documents how he went from covering a memory competition as a journalist… to winning it a year later. These events feature people memorizing thousands of digits of pi, full decks of cards in under a minute, and pages of poetry. Wild stuff.

It’s a weird sport—and a weird reality—that humans can train their minds to do this. I even tried the method of loci from the book. Using it, I memorized 24 Greek gods and goddesses by mentally placing them around my apartment. It actually worked. I haven’t pushed the technique further, but it showed me how powerful these systems can be.

If that interests you, check out the [Art of Memory](https://artofmemory.com) site. The concept is a solid 4/5. The execution of the book itself? Probably more like 3/5.

**TL;DR:** A strange and fascinating dive into the world of elite memory. Great for brain-hack nerds and curiosity-driven readers.
