This book is a masterpiece. I read it in 2019 and have been recommending it ever since. Technically, I didn’t read it this year—but it’s too good not to include.

Murakami is a genius, and this is his best work. It’s a surrealist novel that blends cyberpunk with fantasy, told through two alternating narratives. One takes place in a gritty, dystopian Tokyo. The other in a strange, walled-off dreamworld. The contrast is stark—and intentional.

As the two stories unfold, they slowly begin to intertwine. The convergence is mind-bending. Themes like consciousness, memory, identity, and selfhood are explored through both plots in deeply philosophical ways. The protagonist plays two roles: a “Calcutec” and a “Dreamreader,” each dealing with reality in their own fractured way.

What makes this novel unforgettable is how those two worlds reflect inner experience—conflict, escapism, fragmentation of self. The writing is atmospheric and precise. It lingers. Murakami’s use of imagery and metaphor hits hard in places you don’t expect.

If you’re looking for a one-of-a-kind, thought-provoking read, I can’t recommend this book enough. It challenges your perception of identity, memory, and what it means to be whole.

**TL;DR:** A surreal, genre-blending mind trip. Easily top 5 fiction for me. Read it if you want something bold, weird, and unforgettable.
