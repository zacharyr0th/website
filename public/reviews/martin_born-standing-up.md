Steve Martin is a legend, even if his humor doesn’t always land for me. That said, I’ve always liked his personality and respected his artistry—so I figured this would be a fun, quick autobiography. And it was.

He narrates the audiobook himself and guides you through the stages of his life with empathy and honesty. He wasn’t always a legend, and he doesn’t pretend he was. It’s compelling to follow the full arc—from total unknown to the biggest comedian in the world.

Also: he’s a pretty solid banjo player. He kicks off the book with some banjo sounds, and if you're curious, you can hear him [play here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waeO_S928aU&list=RDEMFvT-gsXxdi4UkntJcCJmjg&start_radio=1). If you’re a Steve Martin fan, this one's definitely for you.

**TL;DR:** Honest, heartfelt, and surprisingly chill. A must for comedy fans or anyone who grew up watching Steve Martin.
