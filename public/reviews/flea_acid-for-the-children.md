This book feels exactly like you'd hope a Flea memoir would—scrappy, honest, a little chaotic, and full of soul. It doesn’t ride the coattails of RHCP fame. In fact, it ends before the band even really takes off. That’s the point.

Flea writes like he plays bass: fast, funky, and full of emotion. The chapters are short and raw, covering everything from family trauma to wild nights to the weird magic of growing up in LA’s fringes. It’s part punk diary, part spiritual quest, and all heart.

As a longtime fan of the Chili Peppers—and someone mildly obsessed with John Frusciante—I would've loved more about the band. But that’s not this book. This is about who Flea was before all of that. And hearing him narrate the audiobook makes it even better.

**TL;DR:** Flea’s memoir is raw, heartfelt, and surprisingly literary. Less about the fame—more about the formation. Worth it for the vibe alone.
