Depending on how you frame it, technology can either look like the root of our problems—or a way out. Rural China has long leaned toward the former. But this book flips that idea around.

Through a mix of essays, on-the-ground reporting, and philosophical reflections, Wang explores how rural Chinese communities are blending traditional life with high-tech tools. Yes, one story involves an actual chicken farm that uses blockchain for accounting—but that’s just the hook. The real story is about how tech is reshaping identity, labor, and survival at the edges of a rapidly modernizing world.

What stood out to me most was the contrast between city-dwellers obsessed with the future, and rural populations more focused on the present. In megacities, people chase utopias; in the countryside, people maintain what already exists. But now those two mindsets are colliding and blending: burned-out urbanites are retreating to the countryside, while farmers are adopting futuristic tools.

It's not exactly a tech book. It’s more cultural meditation with moments of sharp insight. Some parts meander, but it’s worth it for the perspective alone.

**TL;DR:** A smart, layered exploration of rural China and technology. Not much blockchain, but plenty to chew on.
