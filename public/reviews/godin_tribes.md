# _Tribes_

**by Seth Godin**

Seth is a marketer—and a well-known one at that. But marketers often make me roll my eyes. His catch-all, overly generalized style just doesn’t land for me. It feels like he abstracts away all the nuance until the insights lose their value.

I get what he’s trying to do, but the end result is more like a TED Talk than a useful book.

I don’t recommend reading _Tribes_.

**TL;DR:** Oversimplified and overhyped. Skip it unless you really love vague motivational marketing.
