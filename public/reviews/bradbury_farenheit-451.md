# _Fahrenheit 451_

_Fahrenheit 451_ tries to be _Brave New World_—and fails, badly. Reading it shortly after Huxley’s novel only made that failure more obvious. The themes are nearly identical, but Bradbury’s take feels diluted. Where _Brave New World_ is layered and disturbing, _Fahrenheit 451_ feels simplistic, obvious, and overly moralistic.

I don’t know what Bradbury was thinking. This book came out 22 years _after_ Huxley’s, yet somehow feels less mature and more naive. The characters are flat, the story is predictable, and the dystopia feels more like a high school cautionary tale than a fully fleshed-out world.

I know that’s harsh—but if we’re talking about books that deal with censorship, control, and conformity, this one doesn’t hold a candle to its predecessor. Ironically, I think it might’ve benefited from a little more editing… or maybe even should have been thrown into one of the fires that the story is about.

**TL;DR:** _Fahrenheit 451_ is a watered-down _Brave New World_. Same themes, less depth. Don't read it.
