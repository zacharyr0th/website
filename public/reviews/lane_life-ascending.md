Nick Lane is a world-class biochemist. I got a D in chemistry in high school. So yeah—I had to really focus with this one.

Each chapter is essentially a dissertation on a major evolutionary breakthrough: the eukaryotic cell, movement, sex, and so on. It’s dense, but incredibly rewarding if you stick with it.

I first came across Nick Lane through an Andrei Karpathy interview on _Lex Fridman_. Karpathy is clearly influenced by Lane, and that makes sense—Lane studies the origin of life, and Karpathy works on creating it (or something close to it) through AI. The parallels are fascinating, and you start to see how deep biochemistry could shape our digital future.

One fun note: Lane often talks about the Krebs Cycle like it’s a sacred mystery. Turns out, all biology kind of begins there. I still remember learning about it in high school—and wild coincidence, the granddaughter of the guy it’s named after was in my class.

**TL;DR:** Deep, complex, and rewarding. For science nerds, life geeks, or anyone wondering how biology and AI might intersect.
