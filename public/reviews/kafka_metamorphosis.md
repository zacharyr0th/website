# _The Metamorphosis_

**by Franz Kafka**  
_Reviewed by Zachary Roth_

This book was not fun. I wanted it to end as soon as I started, and it made me feel like I was wasting my time. The symbolism didn’t land for me. Honestly, the last time I felt this disoriented by a book was reading _Tarantula_ by Bob Dylan—probably the worst book I’ve ever read.

That said, Franz Kafka himself seemed like an interesting guy. He was a lawyer by day, writer by night, and didn’t get famous until after he died. Tragic and poetic. RIP.

**TL;DR:** Surreal, symbolic, and not my thing. Respect to Kafka, but I won’t be revisiting this one.
