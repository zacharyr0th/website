# _When Money Dies_

Reading When Money Dies immediately after The Ascent of Money, and seeing both ends of a financial spectrum—progress and collapse—was pretty enlightening.

_Money_ means different things to different people. But when it breaks, it’s broken. This book details the hyperinflation crisis in Weimar Germany, showing what happens when a central bank spirals out of control and a currency becomes worthless. It’s chaos and it’s not abstract—Fergusson makes the consequences feel painfully human.

If you’re in crypto or finance, even just skimming _When Money Dies_ gives you context for why people care so deeply about monetary policy, hard assets, and self-custody.

**TL;DR:** _When Money Dies_ is a chilling reminder of what happens when currency collapses. Required reading if you care about money’s fragility.
