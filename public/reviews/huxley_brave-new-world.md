# _Brave New World_

This is one of the few books I’ve read multiple times—and each time it hits differently. The first was in high school (barely finished it), then again in college when I realized just how ahead of his time Huxley was. Reading it now for a third time, it’s clear: this book is timeless.

Published in 1931, it still reads like a warning. A lot of it may seem familiar now—not because it's outdated, but because everyone has copied it since. Huxley didn’t just predict technology or authoritarianism—he nailed the way comfort and distraction can erode meaning.

If you’ve never read it, fix that. If you’ve read it before, it might be time for a re-read. And when you’re done, I highly recommend sailing on to _Island_—Huxley’s lesser-known utopian counterpoint.

**TL;DR:** Still sharp, still scary, still relevant. Huxley saw the future coming—and it’s kind of here.
