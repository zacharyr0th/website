# _Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin_

It’s refreshing to read the personal account of a level-headed individual during a time when humanity, broadly speaking, was not. _Meditations_ by Marcus Aurelius has a similar vibe—but this one’s funnier.

I’m no Franklin scholar, but I know he was a frisky guy and a high-ranking Freemason. None of that makes it into the book. Instead, you get a calm, meticulous, and almost annoyingly rational man reflecting on his youth, his hustle, and his ever-present obsession with self-improvement.

What’s strange is how modern it all feels. Franklin talks about productivity, public image, and personal habits like a 1700s life coach. There’s no real drama, no hot takes—just a deeply curious man trying to live well and do good. It’s kind of dry, kind of brilliant.

**TL;DR:** Franklin’s autobiography is surprisingly chill, quietly funny, and oddly modern. Don’t expect gossip—just a thoughtful dude working on himself.
