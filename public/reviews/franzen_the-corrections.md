# _The Corrections_

Jonathan Franzen’s writing is famously Midwestern. I’m from the Midwest, and I can confirm—he gets it right. The setting, the cultural tension, the quiet emotional repression—it’s all captured with brutal accuracy.

The characters in _The Corrections_ are not easy to like, and the story itself is heavy. You follow the unraveling of a deeply dysfunctional family as the patriarch’s health declines. It’s slow, realistic, and kind of traumatizing. The book was published around 9/11, and for many readers, it carries the emotional weight of that moment in time—disorientation, grief, and the quiet chaos of American domestic life.

If you’re into traditional literary fiction and want something character-driven and melancholic, this is a solid pick. It’s not feel-good fiction—but it is good fiction.

**TL;DR:** Unlikable characters, heavy themes, and sharp writing. A classic if you want realism over resolution.
