# _The Iliad_

**by Homer**  
_Reviewed by Zachary Roth_

Similar to _Dante’s Inferno_, this one was tough to get through.

I’m not a classical literature major—have mercy. Still, I enjoyed what I did listen to, and I came away with a deeper respect for Homer and the long line of bards who passed down this epic tale around firesides.

Would I pass a test on _The Iliad_? Absolutely not. But I do feel like I grasp its lasting impact. Even in fragments, the story’s weight and influence on Western storytelling is undeniable. Maybe I’ll give _The Odyssey_ a (lightly skimmed) shot someday.

**TL;DR:** Dense and difficult, but historically essential. Worth it if you’re curious about the roots of Western epic storytelling.
