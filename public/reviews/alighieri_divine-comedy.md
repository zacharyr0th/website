# _The Divine Comedy_

**by Dante Alighieri**

I tried my best to get through this whole thing, but it’s a lot and I don't have a strong understanding of the old English idioms that this is written in.

That said, it’s undeniably creepy, vivid, and deeply impressive. The historical weight of this text is hard to ignore—it shaped how many imagine the afterlife and moral consequence, and must have been so ominous when it came out hundreds of years ago. At one point, people _memorized_ this poem and recited it by firelight. Bards performed it like mythic theater, using memory techniques that feel right out of _Moonwalking with Einstein_.

Imagine being in the room, or at the firepit, for that when you have no understanding of modern science or reason.

**TL;DR:** _The Divine Comedy_ is dense and demanding, but deeply worth engaging—even if you don’t make it to the end.
