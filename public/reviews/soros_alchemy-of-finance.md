# _The Alchemy of Finance_

**by George Soros**  
_Reviewed by Zachary Roth_

_Alchemy of Finance_ is a collection of George Soros’ essays. Honestly? Pretty boring—aside from his core thesis: the idea of reflexivity in markets. That is, financial markets are self-reinforcing systems where investor beliefs shape outcomes. Think self-fulfilling prophecy, but with capital flows.

I expected some rare insight—maybe a glimpse into the mind of one of the most controversial investors ever. Instead, I came away thinking George was mostly figuring things out as he went—just like the rest of us. He had more time, more conviction, and a massive intellect. But at the end of the day, he’s just been in the game longer.

He’s the blueprint for macro investing—a style that seems simple but is wildly complex. You need to know a little about everything, have serious conviction, and (crucially) get lucky now and then.

### Reflexivity

Soros talks a lot about reflexivity and the **Participation Function** (aka the Observer Effect). The idea is: investors don’t just observe markets—they change them. If enough people believe something will go up, they’ll buy in, and it does go up.

Pair that with concepts like mimetic desire (see my review of [_Wanting_ by Luke Burgis](/writing/reviews/wanting))—and you’ve got a powerful market force.

### Final Thoughts

This book is largely forgettable. Maybe I wasn’t paying close enough attention, but aside from the reflexivity stuff, I don’t know what I learned.

**TL;DR:** Reflexivity is interesting. The rest, not so much. Watch a YouTube breakdown instead.
