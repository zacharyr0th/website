# _Meditations_

**by Marcus Aurelius**

I listened to this while traveling to the Permissionless crypto conference in May. Maybe it was the airports. Maybe it was Miami. Either way—I didn’t love the experience, though it was probably good for me.

More than a book, this feels like something that’s best served in small doses. Think Buddhist kōans… or a desk calendar. 😆

**TL;DR:** Timeless Stoic wisdom, but not really built for a straight listen or read. Better in bite-sized pieces.
