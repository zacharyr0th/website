# _The End of the World is Just the Beginning_

If this had been the first book in the series, I might’ve skipped it. The title has a James Dale Davidson vibe (_The Sovereign Individual_, reviewed here)—and feels a bit too doomsday-ish for my taste. But despite the dramatic name, it’s a good book.

This is Zeihan’s most current thinking, and it extends the threads from the previous three. By the time I reached it, I was admittedly burned out—these books are intense when read back-to-back. But if you’ve made it this far, it’s a worthwhile conclusion to the set.

**TL;DR:** The conclusion of Zeihan’s series. Less balanced than I’d like, but still packed with insight—especially if you’re caught up.
