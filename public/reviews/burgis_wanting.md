_Wanting_ provides a comprehensive exploration of mimetic desire, a concept introduced by René Girard. While Girard framed mimetic desire in the context of literature and anthropology—often linking it to conflict and scapegoating in society—Burgis modernizes the idea by applying it to everyday life: careers, relationships, and consumer habits. Luke does a great job explaining this concept in accessible terms, illustrating how our desires are often shaped by the desires of others around us.

The book explores aspects of modern life where mimetic desire plays a significant role, from career choices to behavior in markets and even the supermarket checkout line. Burgis offers practical insights on how to recognize and navigate these influences, potentially leading to more context-aware decision-making.

While the core concept is compelling, the book can feel repetitive at times, revisiting the same idea through multiple scenarios—much like a Malcolm Gladwell title. That said, _Wanting_ remains a thought-provoking read, pushing readers to reflect on the true origins of their desires. The concept of mimetic desire has gained real traction beyond philosophy, and is especially prevelant in the investment world where its used as a reason behind markets and behavior. Figures like Chamath Palihapitiya have cited Burgis when analyzing how investors often act based not on fundamentals, but on what others are doing.

TL;DR: If our wants are shaped by watching others want, then understanding that pattern becomes a tool for clarity, even autonomy.

Overall, _Wanting_—or at least the core idea of mimetic desire—is a valuable contribution to our understanding of human behavior and motivation. It’s relevant in today’s social media-driven culture of constant comparison but arguably more impactful in financial markets, where people buy or sell simply because others are doing so. At its worst, it’s reiterating common sense; at its best, it offers a powerful framework for understanding both our own actions and those of others.
