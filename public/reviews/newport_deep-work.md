# _Deep Work_

**by Cal Newport**

This book is essentially a long lecture on how to be more productive by using less technology. Newport’s thesis is simple: multitasking and constant digital distractions are killing our ability to do meaningful work. The antidote? Focus—deep, uninterrupted focus.

A lot of this resonates. When I think about the attention span people had 100 years ago compared to now, it’s almost laughable. If you’re reading this, you’re probably doing it on your phone. And that’s fine—screen time is everywhere. I recognized early on in the information age that it’s less about the quantity of time and more about the _quality_ of time you spend using these screens. Still, there's truth in how even the mere presence of a device can reduce cognitive performance - its been proven that having a smartphone nearby makes you partly dumber because it becomes a crutch. Of course you have all of human knowledge a click away but its still up to the receiver to do something with that.

Newport’s ideas are solid, but most of them fall under the umbrella of “common sense”—just better packaged and persistently argued. If you’re already aware that tech can be a distraction, this book mostly reinforces what you already know. Lots of papers are coming out now on things like TikTok breaking your memory because we're not meant to switch context so quickly and effortlessly. People are doomscrolling for two hours straight and sometimes aren't able to even tell you what they just read or watched.

### Newport’s Rules for Deep Work

| Rule                   | Description                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Work Deeply**        | Focus intensely on your work without distractions.                |
| **Embrace Boredom**    | Train your mind by resisting the urge to constantly switch tasks. |
| **Quit Social Media**  | Cut down on platforms that hijack your attention.                 |
| **Drain the Shallows** | Minimize time spent on low-value, shallow work.                   |

There are plenty of online summaries and “Deep Work” playbooks out there if you want to go further. I wasn’t that ambitious about it—but it’s good to know the framework exists.

**TL;DR:** _Deep Work_ makes a strong case for intentional, focused work. It’s not groundbreaking, but it’s a useful reminder in a world of constant pings.
