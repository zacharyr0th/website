# _Animal Farm_

**by George Orwell**

_Animal Farm_ is a must-read for anyone trying to understand how power and propaganda operate. It’s never not timely—because what Orwell’s satirizing is always happening somewhere in the world.

I won’t go too deep here. There are thousands of reviews out there, and let’s be honest—most people read this in high school. I listened to it as an audiobook and finished it in one day.

It’s fun, funny, and scary. That’s all I’ll say.

**TL;DR:** Sharp, quick, and eerily relevant. A classic that earns its status every decade.
