# _Hammer of the Gods: The Led Zeppelin Saga_

Stephen Davis’s _Hammer of the Gods_ is a loud, messy, and entertaining retelling of Led Zeppelin’s meteoric rise, mythic reputation, and tragic collapse. From their explosive formation to their chaotic disbandment in 1980 after the death of John Bonham, the book delivers the energy and excess that defined Zeppelin.

Yes, the infamous shark story is in there. So are the TVs flying from hotel windows.

Jimmy Page is the centerpiece, as he should be: the architect of the Zeppelin sound and vision, already semi-famous before the band even existed due to his session playing and stint with the Yardbirds. But Davis doesn’t skimp on the rest—Peter Grant’s bulldozer management-style, Richard Cole’s road madness, Robert Plant’s sexual magnetism, John Paul Jones’s behind-the-scenes brilliance, and Bonham’s brute-force drumming all get their due.

By 1975, the party was beginning to end. Critics had never loved them, but by now, the band was also unraveling from within. Page and Cole spiraled into heroin addiction. Plant suffered personal tragedy. Bonham, exhausted and drinking heavily, died after consuming an estimated 40 units of vodka in 24 hours. This marked the end of the band and the end of an era.

### Mythology Reinforced (and Questioned)

Stephen Davis' prose is theatrical and loaded with hyperbole. He calls concerts “wargasms” and “Dionysian fiestas,” emphasizes words for dramatic emphasis, and captures the sheer madness of it all.

He leans into the mythology and rumours-groupies, black magic, wrecked hotels, and endless excess. Jimmy Page’s obsession with Aleister Crowley and his haunted Scottish manor gets just as much attention as the music. Davis also pushes back—at least a little. He portrays Page as a musical genius, but also, truthfully, as a predator in his relationship with 14-year-old Lori Maddox. Unfortunately, he wasn’t alone; other rock gods (like Steven Tyler) had similarly disturbing tendencies. Bonham and Grant’s violence, substance abuse, aggressive treatment of women, and burnout are all laid bare, too.

The book occasionally glosses over deeper moments—like Plant’s son Karac’s death, which is barely explored—but it still captures the arc of destruction in the band’s final years.

**TL;DR:** Over-the-top, dramatic, and totally fitting. _Hammer of the Gods_ is part biography, part mythology, and all rock 'n' roll chaos. Required reading for Zeppelin fans—and for anyone curious about the loudest, loosest decade in music history.
