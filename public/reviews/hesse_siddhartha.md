# _Siddhartha_

**by Hermann Hesse**

I don’t have anything particularly novel to say about _Siddhartha_, but it’s a solid book. If you’re curious about Buddhism and don’t know much about it, this semi-fictional account provides a gentle and accessible introduction to key ideas around self-discovery, detachment, and inner peace. If you’re already well-versed in Buddhist thought, though, you might find it overly simplistic or even dull.

The writing feels tailored toward a younger audience. It reads like something that would fit well in a high school or even middle school curriculum. If we swapped out _Metamorphosis_ and put _Siddhartha_ in its place across American schools, there might be just a bit more peace and introspection in the culture.

That said, if you're looking for a deeper or more intellectually rigorous dive into Buddhist ideas, _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_ is a better choice. It’s more reflective and layered—ideal for readers already familiar with the fundamentals of Buddhist philosophy.

**TL;DR:** _Siddhartha_ is a great on-ramp to Buddhist thought for beginners, especially younger readers, but lacks depth for those seeking a more advanced or nuanced take.
