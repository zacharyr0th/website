# Financial Intermediaries

The global financial system's network of intermediaries processes trillions in daily transaction volumes and serve as critical bottlenecks for capital movement worldwide. While home to many reputable institutions, the industry faces ongoing scrutiny over practices that often escape public view, with major banks frequently violating regulatory standards.

| Institution | Regulatory Fines | Violations |
|------------|----------------------|------------|
| Bank of America | $82.7B | 214 |
| JPMorgan Chase | $35.7B | 158 |
| Citigroup | $25.4B | 122 |
| Wells Fargo | $21.3B | 181 |
| Deutsche Bank | $18.1B | 59 |
| UBS | $16.7B | 83 |
| Goldman Sachs | $16.3B | 44 |

The table above illustrates the scale of regulatory violations in traditional banking, highlighting why alternative financial systems have gained attention. While some violations stem from institutional failures, many arise from individual misconduct and deeply embedded conflicts of interest. 

The revolving door between Wall Street and regulatory bodies exemplifies these conflicts: SEC Chairman Gary Gensler's tenure at Goldman Sachs and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's investment banking career before his Treasury Department role demonstrate the blurred lines between regulators and the regulated. This interweaving of private and public interests isn't a recent phenomenon—it's deeply rooted in the foundation of America's modern financial system.

# The Evolution of Central Banking

The Federal Reserve (FED) was established in 1913 as the third attempt at a central banking system in the United States. After the bank runs of 1907-1910 caused by fractional reserve lending, Chase Bank's founder J.P. Morgan and other influential bankers developed a plan that became the Federal Reserve—a hybrid faction within the US government that sets banking standards but operates independently of direct voter control.

## The Mandate

The Federal Reserve operates under what is known as the "dual mandate," established by Congress in the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977.

The two primary objectives are:

1. Maximum employment, which is not a specific unemployment rate.
2. Price stability, which the Fed has interpreted as targeting 2% inflation over time.

The Fed seeks to achieve these goals through various monetary policy tools, primarily by adjusting interest rates and managing the money supply. The 2% inflation target wasn't officially adopted until 2012, when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) first explicitly stated this goal. Interest rates have been trending down for centuries but value calculation over time is a complex topic.

## Changing Value Perceptions

One way to evaluate the Federal Reserve's economic impact on our perception of value is by examining two key relationships: the correlation between its balance sheet and the S&P 500 index, and the long-term trajectory of the US dollar's purchasing power. While correlation doesn't imply causation, the relationship between these metrics has been a subject of significant academic research and market analysis.

Wall street optimists argue that because of the US's dominance, it doesn't matter how much money is printed and centralized intermediaries are a battle-tested system that is worth more than the trouble of occasionally bailing out a few bad actors.

In that world, where does Defi come in? It varies. If you're in one of the wealthier countries in the world, you may utilize Defi as an alternative or speculative investment class but for those in less financially secure countries, you may be using Defi because you don't have any other option.

# Defi

For those in non-financially secure countries, what's the alternative? A continuation of opaque market procedures, unsustainable monetary policy, and hyper-inflationary events of debased fiat currencies becoming the norm?

## Defi's Use Cases Today

### Stable Coins

Let's consider Turkey as an example. The Turkish Lira experienced a reported 78% inflation from 2021-2022, meaning a deposit worth $100 would effectively decrease to $22 in purchasing power. While traditional banking systems offered limited recourse for such situations, digital alternatives now exist.

Non-custodial wallets like Solflare enable users to securely store digital assets without geographic restrictions. These wallets are accessible through private keys or recovery phrases, allowing for borderless value transfer.

Operational security risks and other nuances need to be considered, but this example gives you an idea of what's possible. How easy is it to withdraw $25,000 from your bank? How easy is it to travel across violent borders with that $25,000—especially if that $25,000 worth of value is in a currency other than the USD? The answers are all that it is exceedingly difficult to do so without Defi.

### Censorship Resistance

Real estate debt levels and nationalized industry have taken a toll on the Chinese banking system. In Henan province in 2022, four rural banks froze at least $1.5 billion in deposits, affecting approximately 400,000 customers. Chinese authorities reportedly manipulated the health code system, turning some depositors' codes from green to red, effectively restricting their movement and ability to protest. By July 2022, nearly 1 million Chinese customers were unable to access their funds.

Then tanks were deployed on the protesters who had their funds frozen.

Regarding centralization and censorship, China is extreme, but the world operates on a spectrum. The need for defi also operates on that spectrum.

### Yield Generation

Crypto builders have developed various approaches to generating yields, with varying degrees of legitimacy and sustainability. Some mechanisms represent genuine financial innovation but others - particularly centralized platforms like the now-defunct Celsius - proved to be poorly regulated and over-leveraged systems that misrepresented risks. Liquidity pools stand out as an example of legitimate yield generation that democratizes access to trading profits.

Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are smart contracts deployed on blockchains that enable asset trading through algorithmically managed liquidity pools. These systems compensate liquidity providers in two primary ways: through a share of trading fees or through incentive token distributions. The revenue model for most decentralized exchanges (DEXes) centers on distributing trading fees to liquidity providers - a stark contrast to traditional finance where such yields were typically restricted to institutional market makers.

Below is a list of the top 5 7-Day Average Fees metrics DEXes across various blockchains.

This democratization of market-making represents a significant shift from traditional financial structures. The blockchain infrastructure underlying these systems also brings unprecedented transparency, as trading activities and settlements are recorded on public ledgers, simplifying what was historically an opaque process.

Ryan Selkis, the CEO of Messari, recently published a [thread](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1551874256761659393?s=20&t=cDNrQAr0FsQJXotpRolEAA) of 35 use cases for which you can use Defi. It's worth a scroll.

# A Balanced Approach

The emergence of Defi represents more than just a technological evolution in financial services—it marks a fundamental shift in how we think about and interact with money. The traditional financial systems have served as the backbone of global commerce for centuries but their limitations and vulnerabilities have become increasingly apparent in the digitally age. Defi's promise lies not in replacing these systems outright, but in providing alternatives that address their core limitations: accessibility, transparency, and resistance to censorship.

As we move forward, the challenge will be striking the right balance between innovation and stability, and between decentralization and practical utility. The future of finance likely lies in a thoughtful integration of both traditional and defi, where each serves the purposes for which it is best suited. For those seeking alternatives to traditional banking—whether due to economic instability, political censorship, or a desire for greater financial autonomy—defi offers not just hope, but increasingly practical solutions.

# Expert Perspectives

Dr. Fabian Schär, Professor of DLT at University of Basel:
> "Defi protocols represent a paradigm shift in financial infrastructure, offering programmable and transparent alternatives to traditional financial services."

Gary Gensler, SEC Chairman:
> "While Defi platforms may offer promising technological innovations, they still need to operate within a framework that protects investors and maintains market integrity."

Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum Co-founder:
> "The goal of Defi isn't to oppose traditional finance, but to create an open, accessible financial system that complements existing infrastructure."

# Global Regulatory Landscape

| Jurisdiction | Defi Stance | Key Regulations |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| United States | Cautious/Developing | SEC guidance pending |
| European Union | Progressive | MiCA framework |
| Singapore | Supportive | Payment Services Act |
| China | Restrictive | Complete ban |
| UAE | Embracing | VARA framework |

## Advantages of Defi

The advantages of Defi stems from the permissionless nature of its underlying blockchain architecture. At its core, Defi offers unprecedented transparency through public ledgers that allow anyone to audit transactions and smart contract code. This openness, combined with 24/7 operational capability and global accessibility, removes traditional barriers to financial services. Unlike conventional banking systems that operate within limited hours and geographical boundaries, Defi protocols function continuously and are accessible to anyone with an internet connection, regardless of their location or socioeconomic status.

Perhaps most revolutionary is Defi's programmable nature and cost efficiency. Smart contracts enable automated, trustless execution of complex financial operations without the need for intermediaries, significantly reducing operational costs and eliminating human error. This programmability allows for rapid innovation and the creation of novel financial instruments that would be impractical or impossible in traditional systems. The removal of intermediaries not only reduces costs but also accelerates transaction settlement times from days to minutes or seconds, creating a more efficient and responsive financial ecosystem.

## Future Implications

As we look toward the future of financial systems, several key trends are reshaping the intersection of traditional finance and Defi. Institutional adoption of blockchain technology has accelerated significantly, with major banks and financial institutions not just experimenting with, but actively implementing blockchain solutions. JPMorgan's JPM Coin and the spot Bitcoin ETFs launch exemplify this shift, signaling growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets and blockchain infrastructure.

The regulatory landscape continues to evolve quickly, although, while some jurisdictions like the UAE and Singapore are establishing clear frameworks to foster innovation, others are taking a more cautious approach. The implementation of Europe's MiCA framework and ongoing developments in U.S. securities law interpretation will likely set important precedents for the industry's future.

Perhaps most significantly, we're witnessing unprecedented integration between traditional payment systems and Defi protocols. The rise of stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and hybrid financial products is blurring the lines between TradFi and Defi. As we navigate this landscape, the key to success will lie not in choosing between traditional and defi, but in understanding how to leverage the strengths of both systems to create a more inclusive, efficient, and resilient global financial infrastructure.
