  - 'Unlike exchange wallets, they cant be frozen and give you abilities on-chain that are only possible with self-custody.'

Crypto wallets come in all shapes and sizes, and non-custodial wallets give you, and only you, control over your assets.

It does so through a recovery phrase, which you can only access when generated. From this recovery phrase, a private key is generated. A private key is a secret code that your wallet uses to log in and verify cryptocurrency transactions you send from your wallet. These keys are governed by mathematical functions that prove the funds are yours and that no one else has access to or can recover them. From your private key, a public key is generated. A public key is a label used to identify your wallet on the blockchain and is what you use to send and receive funds.

This contrasts with custodial wallets, which require creating an account through a centralized exchange. These exchanges mandate KYC (know-your-customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) verification, requiring you to share sensitive personal information. While major exchanges are regulated and prioritize security, using a custodial wallet means trusting their ability to protect your data and your funds. Most custodial wallets also require linking a bank account, giving the exchange visibility into your financial activity.

# Custodial Risks

When using a centralized exchange, your funds are held in custody by the platform, which means it controls the private keys. History has shown the vulnerabilities of this approach. Even the largest regulated exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, Robinhood) have frozen trading during periods of high volatility, preventing users from accessing their funds.

The risks extend beyond temporary freezes. Exchange wallets, which hold massive amounts of cryptocurrency, are prime targets for hackers. The Mt. Gox and Quadriga disasters serve as stark reminders—both exchanges suffered catastrophic breaches, resulting in users losing their entire holdings. These incidents gave birth to the crypto community's warning: "Not your keys, not your coins."

Such events undermine confidence in both the centralized crypto ecosystem and traditional finance, as users lose faith in financial intermediaries. While centralized finance relies on trust, these failures have accelerated interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and permissionless systems that eliminate the need for trusted third parties.

# Security is Key

The primary risk to self-custody is losing your login information, making your digital assets unrecoverable. Within most user-friendly wallet, you can change your password with your mnemonic phrase, but if you forget both, you won't be able to log in again. Being organized early on can save you millions.

This is why storing your wallet passwords and mnemonic phrases in secure, recoverable locations is imperative. The best practices are to physically write them down or keep them in encrypted documents on your device—not a cloud-based storage system that can be hacked.

There are estimated to be well over 3 million unrecoverable Bitcoins—about 20% of the current supply, equating to over $200 billion at current prices. This number may be inflated as it could represent long-term holders, but many suspect most of these dormant funds will be lost forever. Only time will tell exactly how many Bitcoins have been lost or forgotten.

To many, the benefits of self-custody greatly outweigh the self-imposed risk of forgetting a password and mnemonic phrase. For the first time in history, you can be entirely in control of your finances and participate in global peer-to-peer transactions at any hour of the day without permission from a centralized intermediary.

# Remittances

The most straightforward argument for self-custody is found in the remittance industry. This is also an argument for crypto, but it wouldn't be possible without non-custodial wallets.

Studies have shown that migrant workers in first-world countries spend up to a month's worth of wages to send remittances back home to their families. Low and middle-income country remittances amounted to $466 billion in 2017. Globally, fees averaged 7.45%, or $34.7 billion. 7.45% equates to over 27 days of a worker's annual income. To put the absolute dollar value of these fees into perspective, the US's non-military foreign aid budget was $34 billion in 2017. Crypto fixes this.

Users can seamlessly send capital over decentralized networks through non-custodial wallets while paying little to no fees—as long as they're not using Ethereum. Solana and other low-fee blockchains can dismantle the Remittance Service Provider (RSP) industry, which relies heavily on banks. In 2017, banks charged an average of 11.18% in remittance fees.

# New Freedoms

Non-custodial wallets enable a new level of freedom. You always control your capital while it's in your wallet. You can transact with any other wallet anytime using any compatible cryptocurrency without permission. You also have instantaneous access to the open world of DeFi, where you can pseudonymously participate in cutting-edge financial services you otherwise would not have access to.

In the same way that bank accounts became safer than holding cash, self-custodying crypto can be safer than using a bank – when done correctly.
