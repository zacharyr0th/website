takeaways:
  - "Blockchains are distributed ledgers that enable trustless transactions through consensus methods, eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries."
  - "Digital wallets provide easy access to blockchain accounts, allowing 24/7 participation in various applications from finance to gaming."
  - "Over the last 15 years, Bitcoin evololved from a peer-to-peer payment system to a 'digital gold' store of value."
  - "Censorship resistance and consensus methods varies among blockchains, with ongoing debates about which consensus methods and infrastructures best serve this goal."

Blockchains are ever-expanding ledgers of transactions with distinct features and functionalities that differentiate them from traditional centralized networks. 

As a result, they open doors to new ways of doing things.
# Core Concepts
## How Blockchains Work in 30 Seconds

Users submit transactions, and then a computer groups them into a list that other computers look at. Once the other computers agree that this list is correct, that list of transactions is added to a previously agreed-upon list. The list, or ever-expanding ledger, is, by design, immutable—or unchangeable. A good way to think about blockchains is that they're read-and-write-only databases; there's no delete button. 

The computers involved with the transactions can earn money by participating in the verification process. Anyone can set up one of these computers to generate a return—and from the blockchain's perspective, the more computers involved, the better. The complexity behind the scenes has begun to be abstracted away in recent years, but it's important to understand the fundamentals until these problems are solved.

## Consensus Methods and Trust

To interact with a blockchain, you need an account, which acts as a digital container for your assets. An account can hold any value, from $0.00 to infinity, and both users and developers can use the assets within an account to engage with compatible applications. Accounts are permissionless, meaning anyone can create one at any time. When best practices for security and operations are followed, only the creator(s) has control over the account.

Accounts can connect to various applications, such as wallets, for viewing and managing assets, and platforms for finance, gaming, gambling, social media, and more. Regardless of the use case, accounts must pay a fee to execute transactions. These fees vary based on the blockchain being used and are required to prevent network overloads and ensure consistent performance.

Unlike traditional markets with limited operating hours, holidays, censorship, and barriers to entry that many cannot reach, blockchains function globally and continuously, enabling on-chain markets to operate 24/7. Anyone with an internet connection can participate anytime, providing global accessibility and uninterrupted engagement.

## Digital Transparency

Specific blockchains are oriented towards privacy, but most are transparent by default. A proper blockchain scanner can openly search and index every detail of every transaction, as shown below.

You can see that 0.00203928 SOL was transferred from one wallet to another on March 18, 03:21:07 AM +UTC, and the transaction fee was 0.000005 SOL (a fraction of $0.01).

## Censorship Resistance

Some blockchains are intended to resist censorship. The goal is for anyone to build and use them, regardless of circumstance. There are no credit checks; an internet connection is the only requirement to open a digital wallet. The reality is that censorship resistance in crypto is a spectrum. Some blockchains do a better job than others, and the measure of this resistance is called the Nakamoto Coefficient. It's based on the number of computers hosting the network, where they're located, and how easy it would be to take the network down. 

The blockchain industry is barely a teenager, and there are many evolving schools of thought regarding how it should operate. Maximalism, tribalism, game theory, and investor bias contribute to a never-ending conversation on which consensus methods and blockchain infrastructure are the most secure and censorship-resistant, so DYOR.

# Bitcoin: The First Blockchain

Bitcoin was the first blockchain and was initially intended to be a peer-to-peer medium of exchange, although its narrative has switched mainly to that of a global store of value. Rather than hold onto, for example, the Turkish Lira or South African Rand and have their spending power decline over time, many have fled to BTC or other cryptocurrencies that enable pseudonymous, secure transfers of value and opportunities for capital appreciation. Bitcoin's low was $0.00099 when someone spent 10,000 on a $40 pizza, and the all-time high was recently $108,958.

## Digital Gold

Physical Gold bars have historically outperformed most assets during periods of economic strife. As a result, Gold has become a haven asset in the eyes of asset managers. It's important to understand that money flows from speculative investments to safe-haven assets doesn't happen automatically. It's a result of trader psychology being influenced by mimetic desire, and it often happens slowly, then all at once.

Besides its use in jewelry and select manufacturing, Gold is perceived to exist outside of the traditional financial system. However, banks are the largest owners of it, and derivatives are frequently used to manipulate its price. In this instance, JPM Chase had to pay a $920 million fine for manipulating Gold and Silver markets.

Even though Gold has performed well in the past during times of distress, this rise in value is not based on any fundamental, intrinsic characteristic. Gold is not easy to transport or store, especially at scale. Try moving $1 billion in Gold across an ocean. Due to the large number of industry players, Gold is a very centralized commodity, and the price will only be appreciated because of a fluctuating extrinsic value. Someone will see that someone else has Gold, and they'll want it.

# Looking Ahead

Blockchains are changing industries and has continued to find more sophisticated applications. From Bitcoin's rise to Solana's dominance and the high performing blockchains being launched every year, the direction of the industry is clear. Its up.
