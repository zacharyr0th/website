DeFi ecosystems are built on interconnected layers - from base blockchain networks and scaling solutions, to core infrastructure like smart contracts and tokens, up to financial primitives such as DEXes and lending protocols. These components enable sophisticated financial services that reimagine traditional finance in new ways. In Balaji's words, YouTube is not TV.

Defi represents a fundamental shift in how financial services can be delivered - moving from centralized institutions to open, permissionless protocols. This transformation began with Bitcoin in 2009, but it wasn't until Ethereum introduced smart contracts in 2015 that the true potential of DeFi began to emerge.

The early DeFi experiments started with projects like MakerDAO (2014) and Compound (2018), but the ecosystem remained relatively small until 2020. The catalyst came during "DeFi Summer" of 2020, when the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols exploded from $1 billion to over $15 billion in just a few months. This period saw the birth of automated market makers (AMMs) like Uniswap as well as byproducts like yield farming, and liquidity mining.

By 2021, DeFi had evolved beyond Ethereum to multiple blockchains, each offering their own innovations - and today's DeFi ecosystem represents an interesting opportunity for traditional financial services are being reimagined through code and consensus.

The rapid evolution of these technologies demonstrates the innovative potential of open-source, permissionless systems. However, with greater complexity comes increased risk and many of these experiments are not well documented. The more open source the better because protocols become more resilient - but theres never no risk.
