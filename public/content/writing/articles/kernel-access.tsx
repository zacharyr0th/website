        <p>
          Kernel access is a powerful capability that allows software to interact directly with the
          core of an operating system. While this can provide performance benefits and enable
          advanced functionality, it also has massive security risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          A recent <a href="/writing/a-simple-operating-system">incident</a> involving the BSOD
          demonstrated the risks of kernel access for necessary software. It made me wonder which
          applications really need kernel access, and which ones could get by with user-mode access
          only.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following is a list of applications that may require kernel access. A good rule of
          thumb is to limit kernel access to only the most necessary applications.

              <td>Anti-Cheat Software</td>
              <td>
                Anti-cheat software utilizes kernel-level access to monitor real-time game
                processes, system memory, and hardware interactions. This allows for detecting and
                preventing cheating methods that operate at a low level, such as memory manipulation
                or driver exploits.

              <td>
                Security software may require kernel-level access to protect the system against
                malware, viruses, and other threats. This access allows it to monitor system calls
                and intercept potentially malicious activities.

              <td>
                Virtualization software may require kernel-level access to manage virtual machines
                efficiently and provide near-native performance. This allows for direct hardware
                resource allocation, memory management, and CPU scheduling for virtual machines.

                Performance monitoring tools may require kernel-level access to interact directly
                with hardware components and low-level system functions. This allows for accurate
                monitoring of CPU frequencies, temperatures, voltages, and other hardware metrics.
                For overclocking tools, kernel-mode operation enables manipulation of hardware
                settings beyond what's possible in user mode.

                Some remote access solutions use kernel-level components to enhance functionality,
                security, and performance. Kernel access can enable features like remote desktop
                integration, screen capture and transmission, and secure encrypted connections.

                Backup and recovery software may request kernel-level access to perform system-level
                backups and provide data recovery features. This allows for creating exact disk
                images, backing up locked files, and performing bare-metal recovery operations.

                Disk management tools may require kernel-level access to perform low-level disk
                operations efficiently. This allows for direct manipulation of partition tables,
                file systems, and disk structures.

              <td>VPN Clients</td>
              <td>
                Some VPN implementations use kernel-level drivers to enhance performance, security,
                and integration with the operating system's networking stack. Kernel-mode VPN
                components can bypass user-mode processing to provide better throughput and lower
                latency. They can also offer stronger security by intercepting network traffic at a
                lower level, though this deep integration also increases the potential security risk
                if the VPN software is compromised.

                Development and debugging tools may utilize kernel-level access to provide essential
                low-level system access and debugging capabilities for system-level programming,
                driver development, and operating system internals analysis. These tools can inspect
                and modify kernel memory, set hardware breakpoints, and analyze system crashes.

        <h2>Be Aware</h2>
        <p>
          While kernel access provides powerful capabilities, it's important to recognize the risks
          involved. The path of least resistance is not always the simplest or most secure, and a
          handful of incumbent kernel architectures will dominate the market in the foreseeable
          future.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meantime, there is plenty of room for innovation in the kernel design space. I'm
          most interested in multi-layered kernel designs that can provide the performance of a
          monolithic kernel with the security and modularity of a microkernel. There may also be a
          demand for kernels specifically designed for a real-time data processing use case, such as
          high-frequency trading or blockchain validation.
