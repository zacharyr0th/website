In oil extraction, natural gas is often released as a byproduct and flared when capturing or transporting it isn't feasible. This practice wastes valuable resources and harms the environment by emitting CO2 and methane. A solution involves deploying mobile Bitcoin mining units directly at oil wells, which generate yield and strengthen the Bitcoin network's resilience.

My entry into crypto began with explaining this concept to investors in a nine-figure commodity fund, who had unexpectedly gained exposure to this emerging asset class. Having spent years researching markets and going down all the pre-requisite rabbit holes, I was able to contribute to the writing needs of multiple firms who were venturing into crypto. This led to a reputation as an analyst with actionable perspectives, culminating in my authorship of Private Placement Memos for two private equity funds that raised $1 billion each. Meanwhile, DeFi summer was in full swing and I was experimenting with the new tools and protocols across a variety of chains.

## Solana DeFi Journey

After completing various contractual writing projects and a brief tenure at a crypto/trading-focused newsletter, I joined Solrise Finance in 2020. This pivot shifted my focus to decentralized finance (DeFi) on Solana, a relatively new blockchain. Solrise raised $3.1 million from <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8938-24" class="text-accent hover:text-accent/80 transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alameda Research</a> to build a non-custodial fund management platform akin to <a href="https://dhedge.org/" class="text-accent hover:text-accent/80 transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dHedge</a> on Ethereum. Over time, the company's standout achievement became the <a href="https://solflare.com/" class="text-accent hover:text-accent/80 transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solflare Wallet</a>, now one of Solana's leading wallets. Wallets are critical bottlenecks in blockchain adoption, serving as gateways to everything else, and working behind the scenes gave me invaluable insights about the onboarding process for users and builders.

### Product Development & User Research

Initially, my role centered on educating users about DeFi and onboarding them to Solana via Solflare. I authored dozens of long-form articles, editorials, and courses to demystify these tools. Much of this work has been re-written and is included in the <a href="https://www.zacharyr0th.com/writing" class="text-accent hover:text-accent/80 transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing section</a> of this website.

One notable feature we utilized at Solflare was their proprietary notification system, which allowed us to send targeted messages <a href="https://docs.solflare.com/solflare/technical/solflare-notifications/api-endpoints/unicast-endpoint" class="text-accent hover:text-accent/80 transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unicasts</a> to power users. I interviewed dozens to gather feedback which was immediately added to the roadmap to iteratively improve the wallet. These insights also informed the roadmap for the Rise Wallet, a new project by Solrise built on the <a href="https://aptoslabs.com/" class="text-accent hover:text-accent/80 transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aptos</a> blockchain.

## FTX, then Aptos

Meanwhile, FTX US launched the FTX Debit Card, which I intended to use for daily purchases. Despite its initial promise, the card never worked, and months of poor customer service raised red flags. I vaguely recall being able to deposit USDC from one chain and withdraw it as USD to my bank without swappingâ€”a helpful, yet concerning feature. This experience with customer service and mounting rumors about SBF's business practices prompted me to withdraw my funds just hours before FTX froze withdrawals.

FTX's collapse sent shockwaves through the industry, nearly toppling Solana and forcing Solrise to downsize significantly. Having already begun building on Aptos, I was impressed with the growing DeFi ecosystem and the tech behind the blockchain itself.

Within a few months I joined the ecosystem team and in October 2023 was promoted to the head of growth for the DeFi and AI verticals. In the next 12 months, Aptos' TVL increased by 600% from <$200m to >$1.2b, and DEX volumes increased by over <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7239688747116564481/" class="text-accent hover:text-accent/80 transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">23x</a>. I closed 24 deals in 12 months, helped architect the DeFi incentive campaigns, and owned Aptos' presence in Electric Capital's report - where we were listed as the 2nd fastest growing ecosystem of the year <a href="https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=top-10-fastest-growing-ecosystems-in-2024" class="text-accent hover:text-accent/80 transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">year</a>. In H2 2024, a few more hires were made and I stepped back from DeFi growth to focus on AI. Aptos' ecosystem has strongly pivoted towards AI and is in the process of building out agentic tooling across DeFi protocols and wallets.

Still lots of work to be done.

## N&W

Along with building out the Aptos ecosystem, I've kept up with all the AI tooling and use Cursor religiously. The project page of this website showcases a few _nights and weekends_ of mine which I regularly update - in particular this <a href="https://github.com/zacharyr0th/website" class="text-accent hover:text-accent/80 transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zacharyr0th/simple-os" class="text-accent hover:text-accent/80 transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SimpleOS</a> - an operating system built with C and Assembly, <a href="https://github.com/zacharyr0th/toml-tools" class="text-accent hover:text-accent/80 transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOML-Tools</a> - a directory of tools to analyze repos within Electric Capital's database (soon to become a website of its own), and <a href="https://github.com/zacharyr0th/portfolio" class="text-accent hover:text-accent/80 transition-colors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portfolio</a> - a unified platform to connect banks, brokers, CEXes, and blockchains.
