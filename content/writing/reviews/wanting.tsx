      <p>
        Wanting provides a comprehensive exploration of mimetic desire, a concept introduced by Ren√©
        Girard. Luke Burgis does an excellent job of explaining this complex idea in accessible
        terms, illustrating how our desires are often shaped by the desires of others around us.
      </p>

      <p>
        The book delves into various aspects of life where mimetic desire plays a significant role,
        from career choices to consumer behavior. Burgis offers insights on how to recognize and
        navigate these influences, potentially leading to more authentic decision-making.
      </p>

      <p>
        While the concept is fascinating, at times the book feels repetitive, hammering home the
        same point across different scenarios. Nevertheless, it's a thought-provoking read that
        challenges readers to examine the origins of their own wants and aspirations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, Wanting is a valuable contribution to our understanding of human behavior and
        motivation. It's particularly relevant in our age of social media and constant comparison,
        offering a framework to understand and potentially resist the mimetic pressures we face
        daily.
