A love story between Michael Lewis, Amos Tversky, and Daniel Kahneman. Michael's writing is great, and these monolithic figures deserve recognition, but this felt too much like an ode to friendship or the trials and tribulations of it. Maybe that's the point.

Either way, you learn about the high-level thinking strategies deployed by Amos and Daniel, as well as how they arrived at their conclusions - of which there are many. Overall pretty good book.
