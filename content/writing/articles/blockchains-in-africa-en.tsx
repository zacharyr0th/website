    <article>
      <p>Before we get into what's happening in Africa, let's ponder the following.</p>

      <p>"Are blockchains a solution looking for a problem?"</p>

      <p>
        This was the keynote remark made by Ravi Menon, the Managing Director of the Monetary
        Authority of Singapore (MAS). He later clarified his answer and stated that "blockchain
        technology is mostly use-case driven: there is almost always a real problem to be solved."
        Ravi's question above implies a common (mis)perception of cryptocurrency's role in developed
        economies and is a consistent argument made by critics and no-coiners alike - although it
        has merit.
      </p>

      <p>
        A recent video of Packy from Not Boring made the rounds on Twitter after he stumbled over
        defining how transacting real estate on a blockchain would differ from the incumbent real
        estate industry. In his defense, that's a tricky question to answer. When dealing with any
        real-world asset on a blockchain, tokens only serve as promissory notes. Sure, you don't
        have to wait 30 days to close the sale, and there are interesting ways you can use a
        tokenized real asset as on-chain collateral. Still, the tangible assets are ultimately
        subject to the reign of the very real governments and countries where they exist.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, it's safe to say that blockchains make more sense in some regions and
        industries than others.
      </p>

      <h2>Africa</h2>
      <p>
        Africa is burgeoning. It's the cradle of humankind and is a resource-rich, expansive
        landscape that can fit China, India, the USA, and half of Europe's landmass within its
        boundaries. Roughly 1.5 billion people live across 54 countries, and it's estimated that 40%
        of the population is 15 years old or younger, and the ITU forecasts that 500 million
        Africans will have smartphones by 2025.
      </p>

      <p>
        Half of the battle of implementing blockchains is educating people on how to use them. While
        the average African may not be acquainted with self-custody or the difference between the
        consensus methods underlying Ethereum and Solana, the average American or European isn't
        either. Africa's young and tech-savvy population has more ability and incentive to learn how
        to utilize blockchains effectively, and many countries have already made leaps and bounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        The more prominent players like Nigeria and Seychelles, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mauritius, Kenya,
        Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Tanzania have already made inroads or formally
        declared their interest in blockchain and fintech industries. This growing adoption signals
        that blockchains offer novel solutions to longstanding problems in Africa and their
        potential is being recognized by world leaders.
      </p>

      <p>Speaking of Nigeria and Seychelles, check out this graph.</p>

      <p>
        Nigeria and Seychelles raised over 50% of all blockchain-based venture capital investments
        on the continent as Africa's YoY VC investment increased by over 1100%. Nigeria is also one
        of the largest oil exporters in the world and has become the wealthiest country in Africa.
        As oil cruises to near all-time highs, Nigeria continues to collect a pretty penny from
        energy-dependent countries like India, China, Europe, and elsewhere in Africa. Nigerian
        millionaires grew by 44% over the past decade, although 60% of the country still lives on
        less than $1 / day.
      </p>

      <p>
        This uptick in crypto-related investments is significant. Investors envision the
        possibilities of blockchains in Africa, and they're putting their money where their mouth
        is.

      <h2>Blockchains as a Solution</h2>
      <p>
        Most countries don't have the luxury of managing their currency. Having the ability to put
        money into the system or take it out using the medium of a domestic central bank is an
        underrated superpower. For example, smaller and less affluent European nations are at the
        whim of Christine Lagarde and the European Central Bank (ECB). If the ECB wants to print
        money until eternity, the less powerful nations in the region must deal with the
        consequences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, the following video from Twitter is cherry-picked, but it sure doesn't make you feel
        good about the Euro or the aptitude of central bankers.
      </p>

      <p>
        With all the hullabaloo surrounding Nigerian investment and advancement, you still need to
        consider that the Nigerian Naira's annual inflation rate accelerated to 16.82% in April of
        this year. Put $100 worth of Nairas (or eNairas) in the bank last year and now have around
        $83.18 worth of buying power. That doesn't bode well for individuals or corporations, and
        unfortunately, much of the world is in a position similar to this.
      </p>

      <h3>Currencies</h3>
      <p>
        Currencies traditionally have acted very similar to languages in that the ones that survive
        only do so with an army and a navy. Bitcoin changed that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bitcoin, and blockchains at large, offer entirely new frameworks for global payment rails to
        function. Using USD worldwide is doable, but there are plenty of limitations, and USD is
        also experiencing surging inflation rates. If you put $100 into your Chase savings account
        to earn 0.01% last year, you have about $92 worth of buying power now (unless you're buying
        groceries or gasoline, then it's less).
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than be subject to the volatility of Bitcoin or the more minor domestic currencies
        that stand to be manipulated by outside forces, African countries can take advantage of both
        stable coins and interconnected token networks to expand upon their economic progress.
      </p>

      <h3>Remittances</h3>
      <p>
        African remittances are in a perpetual bull market. The following represents the number of
        remittances sent via crypto to Africa over the past few years.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're unfamiliar with remittances, they're the payments foreign workers send back home
        to their families. The remittance industry is a reasonably dirty one. Average wiring fees of
        7.45% equate to over 27 days of a low-income worker's annual income. In 2017, low and
        middle-income country remittances amounted to $466 billion, and remittance fees were $34.7
        billion. This is not stealing from the rich and giving to the poor; it's quite the opposite.
        To put the absolute dollar value of these fees into perspective, the US's non-military
        foreign aid budget was $34 billion in 2017.
      </p>

      <p>Crypto fixes this.</p>

      <p>
        Using Solana, for example, you can make 1,000,000 transactions for a cost of ~$10. The issue
        is that banks and vendors in your region may not accept crypto, USDC, or other stablecoins.
        This is why crypto infrastructure in Africa must improve to facilitate low-fee remittances
        and benefit from the many other benefits that blockchains enable.
      </p>

      <h3>Debt & Independence</h3>
      <p>
        China recently banned holding and transacting cryptocurrency (although a few dozen Bitcoin
        nodes are active within the country) in preparation for their own Central Bank Digital
        Currency (CBDC). This CBDC would go hand in hand with China's surveillance state as the
        government would have unprecedented control and monitoring power of its people's finances.
      </p>

      <p>
        Did you spend $100 on American media last month? You can only buy food this month and are on
        the no-fly list.
      </p>

      <p>What does China have to do with Africa? China is Africa's largest creditor.</p>

      <p>Source</p>
      <p>
        Time is a critical component of China's geopolitical strategies. Over the past few decades,
        there has been extensive investment from Chinese firms in infrastructure projects across the
        African continent. Many resource-rich but financially developing countries cannot pay their
        debts. This can lead to several unintended consequences, such as the Chinese government's
        nationalizing African public goods.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than succumb to the external forces that China can put on less affluent African
        countries, blockchains present an alternative financial system for these countries to
        operate with. Businesses would be able to function globally without friction from Chinese
        authorities, and individuals would be able to decentralize their assets.
      </p>

      <p>The situation is not dire but is very complex and needs more international attention.</p>

      <h2>Blockchains as a Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Rather than write more examples of how blockchains can help African economies, it's worth
        noting how they can cause and solve problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        El Salvador adopted BTC as a domestic currency in June of 2021, and the results have been
        nothing more than lackluster. At the time of writing, President Nayib Bukele and the El
        Salvadorian government are down about 30% on their purchase, and citizens are unhappy with
        the situation. I say about because the government has continued to be opaque in its
        operations and has never publicized the address(es) of their wallet(s).
      </p>

      <p>
        You also need to consider that Nayib "deployed the armed forces and civil police around and
        inside the Legislative Assembly" to "coerce the legislative branch to act on his crime
        bill."
      </p>

      <p>Source</p>
      <p>
        I'm not saying that this is an authoritarian regime but what walks and sounds like a duck is
        usually a ü¶Ü.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crypto Critics' Corner recorded four informative podcasts about the situation in El
        Salvador, and all is not well. Those can be found here - 1, 2, 3, 4.
      </p>

      <p>
        The IMF recently downgraded El Salvador's credit rating due to its lack of transparency and
        questionable financial activities surrounding Bitcoin. The rollout of Bitcoin's Lightning
        network has been met with significant resistance from vendors and individuals within the
        country. It simply doesn't make sense for a volatile currency to pay for goods and services
        in a nation where poverty is the norm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hence, my head-shaking apprehension when I found out that the Central African Republic
        (CAR), ranked 188/189 on the global welfare list, chose to adopt BTC as a domestic currency
        this past April. Like many in Africa, CAR is resource-rich, so it is a target of
        commodity-minded governments like China and Russia.
      </p>

      <p>A vibrant river in CAR</p>
      <p>
        Most of the country doesn't have internet (~4% do). Over the past few years, the CAR
        government has become very close to Putin's regime in Russia after decades of internal
        strife and external influence from France. French analyst Thierry Vircoulon told the AFP
        news agency, "The context, given the systemic corruption and a Russian partner facing
        international sanctions, does encourage suspicion."
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other side of the argument, Economist Yann Daworo told BBC Afrique that businesses
        and individuals "will no longer have to walk around with suitcases of CFA francs that will
        have to be converted into dollars or any other currency to make purchases abroad."
      </p>

      <p>
        As Bitcoin and blockchains are more readily adopted in emerging markets across the globe,
        the need for scalable, decentralized networks is more apparent than ever.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Africa isn't looking to disrupt the mortgage industry by putting real estate on the
        blockchain. There are more fundamental incentives and use cases that are garnering support.
        The low-hanging fruit is to replace volatile domestic currencies with on-chain stable coins
        or other token networks, reduce the influence of foreign interests, and introduce
        transparency in financial Governance.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's difficult not to get carried away with this article because there is so much more that
        can be done with blockchains once these other issues are resolved. New creator tools, access
        to financial freedom (DeFi), NFTs, DAOs, self-sovereignty, and all the other good stuff that
        comes along with blockchains will make them more useful and valuable to Africans in the
        coming decades.
      </p>

      <p>But it's not going to be easy.</p>

      <p>If it were, it would have already happened.</p>
