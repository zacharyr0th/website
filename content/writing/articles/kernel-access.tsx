        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Kernel access is a powerful capability that allows software to interact directly with the core of an operating system. While this access can provide significant performance benefits and enable advanced functionality, it also comes with potential security risks. This article explores various categories of applications that commonly require kernel-level access and discusses the reasons behind this requirement.
