        Goldman Gary is at it again. prompt: investor protection oil painting high quality digital
        ornately detailed Goldman unofficially became Gary Gensler’s prefix once he made between
        $41-119 million at Goldman Sachs before former US President Clinton nominated him to be the
        Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. Over the past few months, Gary Gensler has been
        cracking down on the seemingly most inconsequential events in crypto. He’s missed out on
        becoming an iconic fiduciary figure by preventing a spot bitcoin ETF and by not preventing
        FTX’s collapse (even though he had meetings with SBF and friends) because he was too busy
        fining Kim Kardashian for an Instagram post. Meanwhile, the SEC’s entire mantra of
        protecting investors has been scoffed at. Share Type your email... Subscribe While Kim only
        made a few hundred thousand on that post and was fined $1.26 million - the fine was
        eventually dropped and she regularly makes a million per post so it was a questionable
        exhibition by the SEC. Gary Gensler then goes on to brag about it on his Twitter while SBF
        checked off the box declaring that FTX’s bankruptcy is somewhere in the ball park of $10 -
        $50 billion. It’s easy to point out the flaws in a controversial government figure, but
        theres a larger issue looming over the blockchain industry than any one man could muster.
        Share DAOJ Onboarding Onboarding to a blockchain is difficult for first time users. Even
        though there is an estimated 30-40 million developers in the world, thats still less than
        0.5% of the population, meaning 99.5% are technically untechnical when it comes to computer
        science. Blockchains are advanced implementations of concepts in advanced computer science
        categories so its difficult to explain the safety and utility concerns of it to untechnical
        individuals. Even technical individuals have their pushback due to ideological differences
        or disinterest. But the problem goes deeper than this. Getting Money onto a Blockchain There
        are only 2 ways you can fund a blockchain account, also known as a non-custodial digital
        wallet. With a CEX or with a third party integration. Fund it from a centralized exchange -
        this is a whole can of worms and requires a KYCd bank account connected to a KYCd
        centralized exchange (that hasn’t gone under). Purchase it from a third party integration
        within the wallet - examples include Moonpay and Flexa. This always requires KYC protocols
        and account generation, in the same way that a bank requires it, meaning its essentially the
        same as a bank. I’m not including the option to fund it with another wallet because that
        wallet will have had to be funded via one of the two options above. There is also the edge
        case of a miner/validator having natively rewarded tokens but their existence is too
        inconsequential to matter. If you understand the financial plumbing behind both of the above
        options, you can appreciate how flawed the idea of financial sovereignty is from a
        censorship perspective. When the US wants to stop 95% of crypto traffic within its borders,
        they just have to block all transactions with centralized exchanges and prevent individuals
        from transacting with vendors like Moonpay and Flexa. Thats a problem and there is not
        currently a scalable solution which would prevent price collapses. Most people are not going
        to break their bank’s policies, even if the government still allows it. I say 95% of
        activity will stop because there will likely be fringe blockchain users who would be
        considered power users, and miners/validors could keep chugging along if they keep their
        distance from relevant authorities. Its 5% because of a disproportionate amount of technical
        people in crypto compared to the 0.05% resulting from sampling of the general population
        mentioned above. Still, most people won’t do this. When China shut down and banned all
        blockchain activity, there were still a few miners that could be geolocated in the region.
        The censorship resistant aspect of blockchain design has been largely solved from a
        technical standpoint, but not from an on nor offboarding standpoint. Offboarding Lets say
        you were able to get your money into a nifty digital wallet. Now you’re financially free and
        you’re scouring DeFi telegrams with the word ‘Ape’ in their name to find the highest yield
        for your $asUVNslsBUSD tokens. Non-custodial digital wallets can be viewed as investment or
        checking accounts. This one is your investment account and you are putting your entire
        portfolio into $doge. Elon goes back on SNL, says you can buy a SpaceX rocket with it, and
        $doge goes to all time highs. You sell at the top - the sky is the limit. Now all you have
        to do is withdraw the stable coins you received for your volatile tokens and your whole life
        will change for the better. The only ways you can withdraw money from a blockchain without
        using a centralized exchange and a bank are the following: P2P IRL - peer to peer in real
        life. You have to find a willing buyer/seller, negotiate a deal, arrange a meeting with
        someone, and conduct the transaction. Cash for crypto. This can be dangerous - especially if
        the crypto was illegally obtained. Supposedly this is big in Africa but there have been P2P
        exchanges that have been shut down and they’re very uncommon. You can pseudonymously
        purchase gift cards with crypto and configure some plan to pickup items where your name is
        not attached to an address. This is very limiting, but in some cases better than nothing at
        all. Still, most won’t do it. Blockchains and what they enable are amazing feats of
        engineering but the political and financial infrastructure surrounding them is not. This
        infrastructure has been built to throttle the advancement of what many in crypto idealize
        about - financial sovereignty and new tools that take on incumbent industries. A blockchain
        and every thing it enables is only as strong as its weakest link and until further notice,
        on and offboarding is its fatal flaw. Until public sentiment, governmental policies, and
        UX/UI improvements take place (that’s a whole different discussion), its going to be
        difficult to onboard the next/first billion users like everyone talks about in their pitch
        decks. Arguments Against This Article This is an exhaustive list. Users can on and offboard
        with CEXes and bank accounts in countries and Special Economic Zones (SEZ) that allow
        crypto. Yes but this is not scalable for billions of people. Any other argument. Yes but
        this is not scalable for billions of people. A Crypto Idealist’s Solution Blockchains become
        economies that are independent from the real world. Banks have no control, governments have
        no control, markets are free, and individuals have financial sovereignty. Algo-stable coins
        actually work at scale and there are no bank runs in DeFi. But what are the stable coins
        stabled to? There are either algo-stables stabled to fiat (is it still an independent
        economy?), or centralized stables (also stabled to fiat) that can be shut down or go
        insolvent at any moment. More fail points. Is the solution to get rid of stable coins and
        have every asset be volatile? No. Conclusion I don’t like looking at crypto as an
        investment. Its a technology backed by blockchains and it’s price shouldn’t be so focused on
        (anymore, Bitcoin did go up by 6,965,454,545.45% between 2010 and 2021). Lower cap coins are
        manipulated constantly and due to Bitcoin’s mainstream popularity, its now roughly as
        correlated to what the Fed says as every other high-beta risk asset. Blockchains offer
        legitimate solutions and their value is clear to many industries. There are exceptions but
        for the most part, companies and technical individuals are embracing blockchains as new,
        better gateways for payments and near-instantaneous transactions across the globe.
        Governments, on the other hand, are not so sure about blockchains and many see it as a
        problem. They mostly probably want CBDCs and I suspect they will begin banning blockchain
        activity more often when those are ready to be rolled out. Non-technical people see
        blockchains as a confusing and largely unnecessary thing that is killing the planet (only
        bitcoin actually is). Given public and policy sentiment, its difficult to persuade
        anti-blockchain people (no-coiners) when they are not technical. Technical people either see
        the value in it, don’t see the value in it (usually due to not understanding the wider
        macroeconomic and philosophic context), or don’t have time for it (AI engineers). Either
        way, they are the minority. Subscribe below for more technological optimism.
