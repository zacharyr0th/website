        is your time to try. a stained glass depiction of artificial intelligence VCs have been
        pouring billions into AI startups for years, and since ChatGPT went mainstream in December,
        the acceleration has been reaching a fever pitch. ChatGPT was the fastest consumer product
        to hit 1 million users, and interest in it has increased - most recently in China and
        Southeast Asia. google trends search for chatgpt There's a meme now that all you have to do
        to raise money from VCs is build a UI wrapper around a ChatGPT function - like an app to
        give you customized recipes or help you code. Even Snapchat is releasing a new chatbot with

        competition. So much so that Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, came out of the shadows of his
        private islands and submitted his first changelist (request for code access) in years to
        none other than LaMDa - Google's natural language chatbot. It makes sense, given what

        a year ago Â· 8 likes Â· 2 comments Â· Trung Phan The future of Bing (and maybe Clippy) is
        uncertain, but its present has recently become a topic of interest. Bing now incorporates
        variations of the technology used in ChatGPT to answer users' questions and provide a new,
        arguably revolutionized, browsing experience. Of course, there are variations of this
        already in the wild - the best alternative I know of is You.com, which has been
        incorporating a chat search feature for months. At times, it's returned better results than
        ChatGPT in my use cases. As you can see with Notion's AI, GitHub's co-pilot, Replit's AI,
        Meta AI, and SnapChat's new chatbot - to name a few, there will be a lot of competition in
        this industry. So why is OpenAI valued at $29 bil? Let's not get into that. Let's focus on
        what could happen next. Public Perception First, we'll need to see how the public is

        AI advancement will have many more unintended consequences, but what if it slows down?
        Standard expertise acquisition usually follows an S-curve where there is a period of
        stagnation after sudden advances. ChatGPT has passed many difficult exams that are meant to
        represent subject matter expertise. ChatGPT is a subject matter expert at times, but it's
        wrong far too often to be taken into serious consideration as a viable approach for search
        or medicine. A known hallucination rate hovers between 5-10%, and some other bells and
        whistles have raised eyebrows. Ted Goia breaks it down in his newsletter. The Honest Broker
        Over the Course of 72 Hours, Microsoft's AI Goes on a Rampage Just a few days ago, I warned
        about the unreliability of the new AI chatbots. I even called the hot new model a "con
        artist"â€”and in the truest sense of the term. Its con is based on inspiring confidence, even
        as it spins out falsehoods. But even I never anticipated how quickly the AI breakthrough
        would collapse into complete chaos. The events of the lastâ€¦ Read more a year ago Â· 358 likes
        Â· 134 comments Â· Ted Gioia Given the nature of S-curves, some speculate that the progress AI
        has made recently will be the most it experiences for a while (until the next leap forward
        in the sweet spot region of the above graph - maybe quantum computing gets us there?). If
        this stagnation occurs, it will be a repeat of what happened during the AI winters of
        1974-1980 and 1987-1993 - booms and busts in both technological advancement and investment.
        Right now, we're in a boom. Will it end differently this time? Bing requires Edge To access
        the new Bing, you currently have to use the Microsoft Edge browser, which is dull compared
        to shiny new toys like Arc browser. I've been exclusively using Arc for over a month, and
        it's my new default - but I can't use Bing's chat feature. There's also a mobile app for
        Bing, and it's functional but stressful. I've been an Apple person since early college, and
        I don't like using Windows outside of an emulator - so being forced to use a Microsoft
        product in an Apple environment is not ideal. Also, nearly no one uses Edge or Bing - but
        that is interesting in the grand scheme of Satya's strategy. So far - anecdotally, Bing's
        chat feature has been underperforming both ChatGPT and You.com. Poe, brought to you by the
        team behind Quora, has also returned more valuable results. Because of the wonkiness that
        Ted detailed in his newsletter, Microsoft placed a 5-response limit for each conversation.
        Wonkiness Bing has returned strange things to me like "I would rather us not have this
        conversation anymore ðŸ˜”" instead of giving me a wrong answer - as ChatGPT, You.com, or Poe
        would. Note the word return - I am not going to anthropomorphize these chatbots. It's not
        responding to me or talking to me. Prompts are the same as binary code to these things, and
        I view their entire existence as a simple function with emergent properties. On another
        note, I am creeped out by Bing's use of Emojis - look at the screenshot below. It was taken
        from this thread made by Juan Cambeiro. And then there's this one ðŸ˜³. The Underdog In the
        above interview, Satya made it clear that improving Google's search model has been daunting.
        They are monolithic and, until recently, have had no competition. He sees ChatGPT and Bing
        as the first real competitor to Google's prowess. Combine this with the fact that Nvidia's
        CEO went on the record to say that their chips will be 1 million x the power of current AI
        models in the next decade. ChatGPT runs on an estimated 10,000 Nvidia GPUs. Things could get
        dicey for Google if this is true. Satya directly called Google out and will have billions
        spent competing with them. With Edge and Bing only amounting to a fraction of Google's
        market share, what do he and Microsoft have to lose? Every good underdog story has a
        Goliath; this time, its Google. Although, one could argue all of the recent progress in AI
        wouldn't have happened without Google. Transformers are considered game changers in the
        application of AI models, and all of these chatbots were trained on networks that
        incorporate transformersâ€¦ and Google's research department is where the transformer was
        first developed. Google may speed up its historically slow software development cycle and
        blow everybody out of the water. Or maybe Apple will, or Tesla, or Anthropic, or Buzzfeed?
        Inspiration In 1962, Kennedy talked about landing on the moon within a decade.
        Unfortunately, he didn't get to see it, but the US landed on the moon in 1969. Then, all of
        a sudden, Sci-Fi became an exciting topic in mainstream culture, and space blockbuster after
        space blockbuster was produced in Hollywood. You start hearing about Star Wars this and Star
        Trek that and Alien this and Stanly Kubrik's 2001 Space Odyssey that, etc. UFOs are suddenly
        spotted all over the US, and STEM subjects become the academic system's focal point. The
        generation before the moon landing probably thought about space less than the generation
        after it. The same will be the case for radical improvements in AI like ChatGPT. At first,
        the most significant societal changes will be inspiration or fear - similar to Sergey Brin's
        reaction. Then unintended consequences that no one can predict will start happening for
        better or worse. I hope people don't start marrying chatbots. Share We'll end with a photo
